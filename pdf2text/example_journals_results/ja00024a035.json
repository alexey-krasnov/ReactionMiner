Schehlmann Contribution from the Organisch-Chemisches Instituí der Universitat, Im Neuenheimer Feld 270, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany. Received April 3, 1991 Abstract: The syntheses of 1,5-cyclononadiyne (3), 1,5-cyclodecadiyne (4), 1,5-cycloundecadiyne (5), 1,6-cycloundecadiyne (6), 1,6-cyclododecadiyne (7), and 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) have been carried out. Diacetylenes 3 and 4 are prepared from 5-cyclononynone and 5-cyclodecynone, respectively. Compounds 5-8 are synthesized from cyclic diones by thermolysis of the corresponding bisselenadiazoles. The obtained cyclic diacetylenes are further characterized by their bis(hexacarbonyldicobalt) complexes. The geometrical parameters of 3-8 were calculated with force field and semiempirical methods. From the structural data, a correlation between the l3C resonance of the sp-hybridized carbon atoms adjacent to the ethano bridge in 3-5 and the corresponding resonance of the symmetric dialkynes 1,5-cyclooctadiyne (1), 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2), and 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) with the bending angle at this center can be verified. The PE spectra of 3-8 have been recorded, and an interpretation of the bands in the low-energy region is presented. It is found that the splitting of the PE bands that are assigned to the in-plane  -MO’s(ir¡) strongly depends on the size of the methylene bridge. In the case of a propano bridge (e.g., in 3, 6, and 7), the splitting between ttf and  +is relatively large. The splitting of the bands that are assigned to the out-of-plane  -MO’s( 0)decreases with increasing transannular distance. Introduction Monocyclic carbocyclic diacetylenes of medium-sized rings (Cg-C12) are compounds that combine a number of interesting features. (1) They incorporate two linear C—C=C—c moieties in a relatively small framework, thus leading to sizeable interaction of the p orbitals of the two -units.As will be shown, this in-teraction depends strongly on ring size and can be explained in terms of a combination of through-space and through-bond ef-fects.1 (2) Monocyclic diacetylenes are bifunctional compounds and thus show interesting properties with respect to their use as ligands in transition metal chemistry.2 (3) A ten-membered enediyne fragment has been identified as part of the reactive subunit in naturally occuring antitumor agents such as cali-cheamycin and esperamycin.3a,b Consequently, a number of research groups are currently working on the synthesis of such systems, and the applications of cyclic acetylenes in tumor therapy.3' In this report, we will concentrate on the first-mentioned aspect; following a detailed description of the synthesis of this class of compounds, we will evaluate the consequences of electronic in-teraction of two closely spaced  -systemsand discuss this effect in relation to the reactivity toward electrophilic attack on the triple bonds. 12 3*5 6 7 8 9 The ligand properties of cyclic diacetylenes of large ring size (> 12) have been investigated by King et al.2a·6 As anticipated, it was found that reactivity not only depends on the relevant ring size but also on· the metal used. Since unsubstituted carbocyclic diacetylenes of medium-sized rings were unknown, we started to explore different approaches to their synthesis. The two routes described in this paper lead to the following six diacetylenes: 7 Dedicated to Professor Horst Prinzbach on the occasion of his 60th birthday. * Present address: Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Sandhofer Strasse 116, D-6800 Mannheim 31, Germany. 1,5-cyclononadiyne (3), 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2),5 1,5-cyclodecadiyne (4), 1,5-cycloundecadiyne (5), 1,6-cycloundecadiyne (6), and 1,6-cyclododecadiyne (7).7 For the sake of comparison, we have also prepared 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) and 1,8-cyclotetradecadiyne (9). The former was prepared according to the procedure given below (this compound has already been synthesized via a different route8'), while the latter was obtained by a modified cyclization method originally described by Dale et al.8b Comparison of the photoelectron spectra of the medium-sized rings 1,5-cyclooctadiyne (l)4 and 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2)5 revealed a strong / interaction5for both of the linear combinations of the in-plane -MO’s.For 1 strong / interactionis observed for 7ag, while for 2 the corresponding MO is 6au.

Soc., Vol. 113, No. 24, 1991 9259 Scheme I. Synthetic Strategy to Obtain the Diacetylenes 2-8 approached in the molecular plane. Several experiments with 2 and silver trifiate or CpCo(CO)2 have been found to be in line with these predictions.20 Synthesis Since ring-closing reactions to medium-sized rings are difficult to execute, we decided to start from commercially available medium-sized bicyclic systems that already contained the required number of carbon atoms. Scheme I demonstrates two possible approaches to 3-8. The key reaction in both alternatives is the decomposition of a selenadiazole ring to yield the corresponding triple bond, a reaction first used by Lalezari9 and later applied by Meier et al. to construct cyclic enynes.10 Starting from either a bicyclic benzene derivative I or cis,trans,trans-1,5,9-cyclo-dodecatriene 1' (see Scheme I) both of which can be partially hydrogenated to the bicyclic tetrasubstituted ethylene derivative II, we obtain the diketone III on ozonolysis. Transformation can yield either the bicyclic enone VI (path B) or the bissemicarbazone IV (path A). The enone can be rearranged to the cyclic alkynone VIII in a one-pot reaction.12 The last steps of both routes involve the preparation of the aforementioned selenadiazoles V or X, according to a procedure reported by Lalezari et al.9 Thermolysis yields the desired cyclic bisacetylenes XI. The starting material for 3 is 5-cyclononynone (10),* 11 which can be transformed to the semicarbazone 11 and the selenadiazole 12 (see Scheme II). Upon heating the latter leads to 3, which is highly strained and decomposes rapidly at room temperature. The route to 4 also follows path B of Scheme I. In this case we begin with 5-cyclodecynone (13),12 which is transformed to the semicarbazone 14 and the selenadiazole 16. The other possible selenadiazole, 15, is detected only in traces. Route A of Scheme I has been used to prepare 5-8 (see Scheme II). To prepare a mixture of 5 and 6, the starting point is 1,6-cycloundecadione (17).13 On reaction with Se02 the corre-(9) Lalezari, I.; Shafiee, A.; Yalpani, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1969, 5105. Angew.

Pyrolysis of 19-21 yields a 1:1 mixture of 5 and 6. Both diynes can be separated by column chroma-tography in 20-30% yield. From 1,7-cyclododecadione (22)14 and its bissemicarbazone 23, a mixture of the two bisselenadiazoles 24 and 25 results. By heating this mixture with copper powder, the two diynes 7 and 8 are obtained in 4% and 27% yield, re-spectively. To characterize 2-8 further we have treated them with excess amounts of octacarbonyldicobalt to obtain the bis(hexa-carbonyldicobalt) products 2a-8a. For 2a, 3a, 4a, and 5a we were able to confirm the bistetrahedral arrangement by X-ray inves-tigations on single crystals obtained from pentane solutions.15 Properties of 3-8 The most interesting properties of cyclic diacetylenes are related to their structure. Since we have not been able to grow crystals of 3-7 so far, we have to rely on model calculations to elucidate the geometrical parameters of these molecules. In Table I we have listed the most important parameters, the intramolecular distances a and b, as well as the bending angles a and ß as defined below. ^m These data were derived from force field and semiempirical calculations. The methods used were the MMP2,16 the MIN-DO/3,17a and the MNDO!7b methods. The data in Table I are (13) Plattner, P. A. Helv. Chim Acta 1944, 27, 801. (14) Alvik, T.; Dale, J. Acta Chem.

Also included in this diagram are the values of a derived from the X-ray structures of 1, 2, and 8 as well as the corresponding 13C values. As can be seen from this figure, a linear correlation is obtained. To rationalize the ratio of the selenadiazoles obtained from 13 and 17, respectively (see Scheme II), we have carried out force field calculations16 on e/s-cyclodeca-l-en-5-yne (26) and cis-cyclodeca-1 -en-6-yne (27) as models for 15 and 16. As a model for 19 we chose ris,cis-cycloundeca-l,5-diene (28) and for 20 and 21 c/j,c/5-cycloundeca-1,6-diene (29). The calculations predict very similar energies for 26 and 27 and about 2.4 kcal/mol more strain energy for 28 than for 29. These data suggest the formation of equal amounts of 2 and 4 in the case of 14 and a ratio of about 1:3 for 5 and 6, respectively. The difference between experiment and prediction excludes arguments based on product stability. (17) (a) Bingham, R. C.; Dewar, M. J. S.; Lo, D. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975, 97, 1285. (b) Dewar, M. J.

PE Spectra of 3-9 If one considers carbocyclic diacetylenes as members of the class of cyclophanes (i.e., two  -systemsconnected by at least two linking units—in the case of 1-9 one may even classify these compounds as the most simple \"superphanes”), then an analysis of their electronic structure from a similar approach as documented for the well-known benzenoid cyclophanes18 seems appropriate. Therefore, we have recorded the PE spectra of the above medi-um-sized diacetylenes—the PE spectra of l,4 2,5 and 85 have been discussed already. To give an idea of the appearance of the PE spectra we have reproduced those of 3, 4, 6, and 9 in Figure 2. The measured ionization energies of 1-8 are collected in Table II. On the basis of the assumption of the validity of Koopmans’ theorem (-(j = /vj),19 we have correlated the recorded vertical ionization energies, 7vj, with the calculated orbital energies of the neutral ground state, -tj. This assumption allows us to analyze the PE spectra of 3-9 in terms of through-space and through-bond interactions11”·10’20 with arguments from perturbation theory.21 In the low-energy region (below 11 eV), we anticipate four ionic states for 3-9, arising from the ionization out of the “in-plane”, ir¡, and “out-of-plane\", ir0, linear combinations of the  -fragments.On top of this the C-C  orbitalsof the -(CH2)„-chains have the correct symmetry to interact with either one of the  ;com-binations shown below; for an even-numbered n this is  4,and for an odd-numbered n it is the trf combination. Furthermore, i-8 U « M HU ~ ·· rr¡*  ;\" 0* „\"the  0orbitals are prone to destabilizing interactions with the adjacent C-Hbonds (hyperconjugation). As connection by a single -CHj-fragment ( =1) or direct conjugation (linear arrangement,  =0) is not considered here, we can use the results obtained from PE spectroscopy to evaluate the different effect (18) Heilbronner, E.; Yang, Z.

A glance at the low-energy region in the depicted PE spectra shows that the separation and intensities of the ionization bands vary considerably from compound to compound. To account for these differences we will analyze the spectra with the following questions as a guideline: (1) To what extent is the energy separation of the orbitalsinfluenced by transannular distance? (2) Can the different effect of even-or odd-numbered bridges easily be discerned? Are the larger butano and pentano chains at all effective? (3) If a combination of both odd-and even-numbered linking units is present (as in 3 or 5), which group dominates? (4) Which effect is more pronounced, through-space or through-bond interaction? (5) Can the ordering of the  0orbitals be assigned with cer-tainty? (6) Can our results on symmetry and sequence of the energy levels of the four highest occupied MO’s be used to predict re-activity toward electrophilic attack on the acetylenic moieties? In other words, when do we expect a reaction to proceed in the plane of the ring and when will it commence from above the plane? To answer some of these questions we will draw on the results obtained from our previous studies on 2 and 85 and supplement these with further calculations on an empirical as well as semi-empirical level for the remaining diacetylenes. For 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2), we expect strong interactions between the  skeleton and the trf linear combinations to dominate the through-space interaction. In order to estimate the energy of the  ,bands, taking only the most important contributions into consideration, we have carried out LCFO (linear combination of fragment orbitals) calculations with the parameters listed below. The basis energy of the triple bond was deduced from the PE spectra of a number of open-chain diacetylenes.22 9262 J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 113, No. 24, 1991 Gleiter et al. <  | | >= -10.3 eV (1) For the basis energy of the localized C-C single bonds, the value < „| |<7„>=-14.0 eV (2) was selected. This value has been used in a similar investigation of the PE spectra of several cyclophanes.23 The off-diagonal terms <  | | >= -1.33 eV (3) <<7„|HK> = -2.0 eV (4) stem from interaction energies between localized orbitals of cyclic diacetylenes calculated by the MINDO/3 method. To account for the through-space interactions between the triple bonds we have assumed an exponential dependence of the matrix element (  ' 2)= -1.75e-°-4!</eV (5) where d denotes the (mean) distance between the -bondsderived from MNDO calculations or, if available, X-ray data (see Table I). The cross terms of eqs 3-5 have been adjusted in order to reproduce the experimental data. The out-of-plane  orbitalshave not been included since in this simple approach their energies vary only if hyperconjugation with the adjacent C-H bonds is also considered. The results of the calculations are given in Table II. Although this procedure neglects the hydrogen atoms as well as the indi-vidual molecular geometry, the good agreement between the calculated and experimental values shows that the complex in-terplay of through-space and through-bond effects can be explained qualitatively on this level.24 In addition to the empirical method, we have used the MIN-DO/3 procedure,178 which has proven quite reliable in predicting PE bands of many unsaturated hydrocarbons. Studies on 1 have revealed4 that the ethano bridges cause a sequence *above  ~,opposite to the ordering that is expected solely from through-space interaction. This sequence has been ascribed to a strong interaction between +and the  -skeleton.In 2 on the other hand, the sequence \"on top of  ,+is predicted.5 Here the propano bridge interacts strongly with  \"and thus reinforces the through-space ordering. To correlate the superimposed effects in these systems we have divided the nine diacetylenes into two groups (see Figure 3a,b). The criterion imposed is the length of the methylene chain relevant to the discussion, which is always drawn on the left-hand side of the depicted formula (we will concentrate on  =2 and  =3 and consider the larger butano or pentano bridges as relatively ineffective for through-bond interaction; for the justification of this assumption, see below). The cycles containing an even-numbered n have been collected in Figure 3a and those with an odd-numbered n in Figure 3b. This classification lets us distinguish a number of effects. (1) The effect of transannular overlap is nicely accounted for by the exponential decline of the relative split assigned to the out-of-plane orbitals. Starting at 1 with a strong split,  ( 0+/ 0~)= 0.9 eV, this difference is reduced to =0.3 eV in 2 and remains at about 0.25 eV in all larger rings. For instance, the spectrum of 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) is more or less identical with that of the next higher symmetrical homologue, 1,8-cyclotetradecadiyne (9) (/vj = 9.07 and 9.34 eV). Thus, we conclude that a transannular distance of d = 3 Á or less is necessary to induce through-space interaction. (2) As is evident from the two figures, the ethano bridge (Figure 3a) leads to an overall more closely spaced band structure, which can be traced back to destabilization of the  *orbital while the wf combination remains unaffected.

The interplay of through-space and through-bond effects leading to the observed band structure in 3. with a propano bridge (Figure 3b) show one band at an energy below /vj = 9 eV, which, according to the calculations, is due to an ionization event from the ir¡~ combination. The virtually identical PE spectra of 4 and 5 as well as those of 6 and 7 confirm our assumption that the butano or pentano bridges do not influence the ordering of the four highest occupied MO’s to any extent and justify our classification (« = 2 or  =3) as shown in Figure 3a,b. An explanation for this behavior can be traced back to the fact that the longer methylene chains contain a large number of Carbocyclic Diacetylenes J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 113. No. 24. 1991 9263 fragment a orbitals that belong to different symmetry groups and thus allow for interaction with both the bonding and the anti-bonding combinations of the orbitals.(3) 1,5-Cyclononadiyne (3) is represented in both figures. Here the effects of both bridges are competing with each other. Through-space interaction, inductive effect, and hyperconjugation place ir¡+ below irf and  0+below irf (see left of Figure 4). Interaction with the C2H4 bridge moves ir¡+ on top of  0+,leaving the other levels unchanged (middle of Figure 4). The propano bridge on the other hand only destabilizes irf (/„j = 8.85 eV), and thus the sequence shown on the right of Figure 4 is obtained. (4) From the above discussion, a picture emerges that indicates that if an ethano or propano bridge is present, through-bond interaction will dominate through-space interaction even though the latter should be substantial because of the small transannular distance. This effect is especially pronounced in 1,5-cyclooctadiyne (1). According to our calculations, in this case the strong through-space interaction caused by the small transannular dis-tance (d = 2.56 Á) is overruled by through-bond interaction with the ethano bridge. Thus, we conclude that the natural orbital sequence in 1 is reversed (see Figure 3a), and the bonding  +combination lies at lower ionization energy than its antibonding irf counterpart (for a different interpretation, see ref 4). For larger rings neither effect plays an important part in the relative order of the -MO’s.(5) It is difficult to rationalize the result that the MINDO/3 procedure calculates the antibonding irf combination to be at higher orbital energy than the bonding 0+combination for all even-numbered n. For odd n the natural order ( 0+below irf) also varies strongly (see Table II). Thus the assignments of these MO’s have been made only tentatively. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the ordering of the ir-N~ levels when com-paring the results obtained for 4, 5, and 8 (see Table II). While the semiempirical calculations predict *to be at lower orbital energy than irf (strong influence of the ethano or butano bridge), the LCFO analysis comes to the opposite conclusion ( *at higher energy, i.e., natural order). In Figure 3a we have assigned the bands from the results of the latter procedure. (6) If reaction with an electrophile at the triple bonds of the discussed compounds is primarily influenced by the HOMO/ LUMO interaction, then only 2, and to a lesser extent 6 and 7, should show a pronounced differentiation concerning the direction of attack of the incoming electrophile. In these cases, the HOMO is of the in-plane type and lies at exceptionally high values as compared to the remaining p orbital combinations (the HOMO energy is separated by 0.65 eV (2), 0.37 eV (6), and 0.33 eV (7) from the remaining bands). All other compounds show a relatively close spacing of MO energies, and consequently any selectivity based on the MO sequence alone is more than questionable. On top of the electronic effects, one must consider steric restraints imposed by the length of the connecting moieties, which will direct the mode of reaction irrespective of any electronic contributions. To study these influences we are currently investigating the re-action of a number of electrophiles with 2-8. Conclusions We have presented two complementary methods to prepare medium-sized cyclic diacetylenes. For 1-5 we have found a correlation between the angle at the sp center next to the ethano bridge and the 13C shift of this C atom. The PE spectroscopic investigations reveal a strong splitting of the in-plane -bandsin the cases of 2, 3, and 6, i.e., in those molecules where at least one propano group connects the two acetylene moieties. Our inves-tigations furthermore show that the ethano and butano bridges lead to a small splitting between the  -bands.Experimental Section Preparation of the Bissemicarbazones 18 and 23. To a solution of 0.05 mol of the cyclic dione (17, 22) in 200 mL of dry ethanol was added a 3-fold amount of semicarbazide-acetate in 250 mL of ethanol. After 30 h at room temperature, the precipitate was filtered off and washed with ethanol. 1,6-Cycloundecanedione bissemicarbazone (18) was obtained in 70% yield, and 1,7-cyclododecanedione bissemicarbazone (23) was obtained in 94% yield. 18: mp 218 °C dec; IR (KBr) v 3465, 3100, 2943, 1640, 1587, 1470 cm'1. 23: mp 230 °C dec; IR (KBr) v 3454, 3186, 2926, 1682, 1582, 1463 cm\"'.

Preparation of the Cyclic Bis[l,2,3]selenadiazoles 19, 20, 21, 24, and 25 from the Cyclic Semicarbazones 18 and 23. To a suspension of 0.048 mol of 18 or 23 in freshly distilled dioxane was added a saturated Se02/H20 solution (3-fold molar amount) dropwise. The addition was carried out in the dark with stirring. After 24 h, the red suspension was concentrated, and 500 mL of CHC13 was added. The CHC13 solution was washed three times with 150 mL of water. The water phase was extracted with 100 mL of CHC13. After filtration over Celite, the CHC13 solutions were dried with MgS04 and the solvent was evaporated. Further purification was achieved by flash chromatography on silica gel, with CHC13 in the case of 4,5,6,7,11,12,13,14-octahydrocyclododeca-[ 1,2-</:7,8-</']bis [ 1,2,3]selenadiazole (24) and 4,5,6,7,8,12,13,14-octa-hydrocyclododeca[l,2-¡/:9,8-í/']bis[l,2,3]selenadiazole (25) and with ether in the case of 4,5,6,10,11,12-hexahydro-13//-cycloundeca[ 1,2-í/:6,7-í/']bis[l,2,3]selenad¡azole (19), 4,5,6,7,11,12-hexahydro-13//-cycloundeca[ 1,2-</:8,7-¡/']bis[ 1,2,3]selenadiazole (20), and 4,5,6,7,8,12-hexahydro-13//-cycloundeca[ 1,2-d:9,S-d']bis[l,2,3]selenadiazole (21).

        "Synthesis and Properties of Medium-Sized (C9-C12) Carbocyclic Diacetylenes1-R. Gleiter,* D. Kratz, W. Schafer,$ and V. Schehlmann Contribution from the Organisch-Chemisches Instituí der Universitat, Im Neuenheimer Feld 270, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany. Received April 3, 1991Abstract: The syntheses of 1,5-cyclononadiyne (3), 1,5-cyclodecadiyne (4), 1,5-cycloundecadiyne (5), 1,6-cycloundecadiyne (6), 1,6-cyclododecadiyne (7), and 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) have been carried out. Diacetylenes 3 and 4 are prepared from 5-cyclononynone and 5-cyclodecynone, respectively. Compounds 5-8 are synthesized from cyclic diones by thermolysis of the corresponding bisselenadiazoles. The obtained cyclic diacetylenes are further characterized by their bis(hexacarbonyldicobalt) complexes. The geometrical parameters of 3-8 were calculated with force field and semiempirical methods. From the structural data, a correlation between the l3C resonance of the sp-hybridized carbon atoms adjacent to the ethano bridge in 3-5 and the corresponding resonance of the symmetric dialkynes 1,5-cyclooctadiyne (1), 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2), and 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) with the bending angle at this center can be verified. The PE spectra of 3-8 have been recorded, and an interpretation of the bands in the low-energy region is presented. It is found that the splitting of the PE bands that are assigned to the in-plane  -MO’s(ir¡) strongly depends on the size of the methylene bridge. In the case of a propano bridge (e.g., in 3, 6, and 7), the splitting between ttf and  +is relatively large. The splitting of the bands that are assigned to the out-of-plane  -MO’s( 0)decreases with increasing transannular distance.",
        "Monocyclic carbocyclic diacetylenes of medium-sized rings (Cg-C12) are compounds that combine a number of interesting features. (1) They incorporate two linear C—C=C—c moieties in a relatively small framework, thus leading to sizeable interaction of the p orbitals of the two -units.As will be shown, this in-teraction depends strongly on ring size and can be explained in terms of a combination of through-space and through-bond ef-fects.1 (2) Monocyclic diacetylenes are bifunctional compounds and thus show interesting properties with respect to their use as ligands in transition metal chemistry.2 (3) A ten-membered enediyne fragment has been identified as part of the reactive subunit in naturally occuring antitumor agents such as cali-cheamycin and esperamycin.3a,b Consequently, a number of research groups are currently working on the synthesis of such systems, and the applications of cyclic acetylenes in tumor therapy.3'In this report, we will concentrate on the first-mentioned aspect; following a detailed description of the synthesis of this class of compounds, we will evaluate the consequences of electronic in-teraction of two closely spaced  -systemsand discuss this effect in relation to the reactivity toward electrophilic attack on the triple bonds.",
        "The ligand properties of cyclic diacetylenes of large ring size (> 12) have been investigated by King et al.2a·6 As anticipated, it was found that reactivity not only depends on the relevant ring size but also on· the metal used. Since unsubstituted carbocyclic diacetylenes of medium-sized rings were unknown, we started to explore different approaches to their synthesis. The two routes described in this paper lead to the following six diacetylenes:7 Dedicated to Professor Horst Prinzbach on the occasion of his 60th birthday. * Present address: Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Sandhofer Strasse 116, D-6800 Mannheim 31, Germany. 1,5-cyclononadiyne (3), 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2),5 1,5-cyclodecadiyne (4), 1,5-cycloundecadiyne (5), 1,6-cycloundecadiyne (6), and 1,6-cyclododecadiyne (7).7 For the sake of comparison, we have also prepared 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) and 1,8-cyclotetradecadiyne (9). The former was prepared according to the procedure given below (this compound has already been synthesized via a different route8'), while the latter was obtained by a modified cyclization method originally described by Dale et al.8bComparison of the photoelectron spectra of the medium-sized rings 1,5-cyclooctadiyne (l)4 and 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2)5 revealed a strong / interaction5for both of the linear combinations of the in-plane -MO’s.For 1 strong / interactionis observed for 7ag, while for 2 the corresponding MO is 6au.

Synthetic Strategy to Obtain the Diacetylenes 2-8approached in the molecular plane. Several experiments with 2 and silver trifiate or CpCo(CO)2 have been found to be in line with these predictions.20 SynthesisSince ring-closing reactions to medium-sized rings are difficult to execute, we decided to start from commercially available medium-sized bicyclic systems that already contained the required number of carbon atoms. Scheme I demonstrates two possible approaches to 3-8. The key reaction in both alternatives is the decomposition of a selenadiazole ring to yield the corresponding triple bond, a reaction first used by Lalezari9 and later applied by Meier et al. to construct cyclic enynes.10 Starting from either a bicyclic benzene derivative I or cis,trans,trans-1,5,9-cyclo-dodecatriene 1' (see Scheme I) both of which can be partially hydrogenated to the bicyclic tetrasubstituted ethylene derivative II, we obtain the diketone III on ozonolysis. Transformation can yield either the bicyclic enone VI (path B) or the bissemicarbazone IV (path A). The enone can be rearranged to the cyclic alkynone VIII in a one-pot reaction.12 The last steps of both routes involve the preparation of the aforementioned selenadiazoles V or X, according to a procedure reported by Lalezari et al.9 Thermolysis yields the desired cyclic bisacetylenes XI.",
        "The starting material for 3 is 5-cyclononynone (10),* 11 which can be transformed to the semicarbazone 11 and the selenadiazole 12 (see Scheme II). Upon heating the latter leads to 3, which is highly strained and decomposes rapidly at room temperature. The route to 4 also follows path B of Scheme I. In this case we begin with 5-cyclodecynone (13),12 which is transformed to the semicarbazone 14 and the selenadiazole 16. The other possible selenadiazole, 15, is detected only in traces.",

PE Spectra of 3-9If one considers carbocyclic diacetylenes as members of the class of cyclophanes (i.e., two  -systemsconnected by at least two linking units—in the case of 1-9 one may even classify these compounds as the most simple \"superphanes”), then an analysis of their electronic structure from a similar approach as documented for the well-known benzenoid cyclophanes18 seems appropriate. Therefore, we have recorded the PE spectra of the above medi-um-sized diacetylenes—the PE spectra of l,4 2,5 and 85 have been discussed already. To give an idea of the appearance of the PE spectra we have reproduced those of 3, 4, 6, and 9 in Figure 2. The measured ionization energies of 1-8 are collected in Table II.",
        "On the basis of the assumption of the validity of Koopmans’ theorem (-(j = /vj),19 we have correlated the recorded vertical ionization energies, 7vj, with the calculated orbital energies of the neutral ground state, -tj. This assumption allows us to analyze the PE spectra of 3-9 in terms of through-space and through-bond interactions11”·10’20 with arguments from perturbation theory.21In the low-energy region (below 11 eV), we anticipate four ionic states for 3-9, arising from the ionization out of the “in-plane”, ir¡, and “out-of-plane\", ir0, linear combinations of the  -fragments.On top of this the C-C  orbitalsof the -(CH2)„-chains have the correct symmetry to interact with either one of the  ;com-binations shown below; for an even-numbered n this is  4,and for an odd-numbered n it is the trf combination. Furthermore,„\"the  0orbitals are prone to destabilizing interactions with the adjacent C-Hbonds (hyperconjugation). As connection by a single -CHj-fragment ( =1) or direct conjugation (linear arrangement,  =0) is not considered here, we can use the results obtained from PE spectroscopy to evaluate the different effect(18) Heilbronner, E.; Yang, Z.

A glance at the low-energy region in the depicted PE spectra shows that the separation and intensities of the ionization bands vary considerably from compound to compound. To account for these differences we will analyze the spectra with the following questions as a guideline:(1) To what extent is the energy separation of the orbitalsinfluenced by transannular distance?",
        "(2) Can the different effect of even-or odd-numbered bridges easily be discerned? Are the larger butano and pentano chains at all effective?",
        "(3) If a combination of both odd-and even-numbered linking units is present (as in 3 or 5), which group dominates?",
        "(4) Which effect is more pronounced, through-space or through-bond interaction?",
        "(5) Can the ordering of the  0orbitals be assigned with cer-tainty?",
        "(6) Can our results on symmetry and sequence of the energy levels of the four highest occupied MO’s be used to predict re-activity toward electrophilic attack on the acetylenic moieties? In other words, when do we expect a reaction to proceed in the plane of the ring and when will it commence from above the plane?",
        "To answer some of these questions we will draw on the results obtained from our previous studies on 2 and 85 and supplement these with further calculations on an empirical as well as semi-empirical level for the remaining diacetylenes. For 1,6-cyclodecadiyne (2), we expect strong interactions between the  skeleton and the trf linear combinations to dominate the through-space interaction.",
        "In order to estimate the energy of the  ,bands, taking only the most important contributions into consideration, we have carried out LCFO (linear combination of fragment orbitals) calculations with the parameters listed below. The basis energy of the triple bond was deduced from the PE spectra of a number of open-chain diacetylenes.229262 J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 113, No. 24, 1991 Gleiter et al.",
        "For the basis energy of the localized C-C single bonds, the value< „| |<7„>=-14.0 eV (2)was selected. This value has been used in a similar investigation of the PE spectra of several cyclophanes.23<  | | >= -1.33 eV (3) <<7„|HK> = -2.0 eV (4)stem from interaction energies between localized orbitals of cyclic diacetylenes calculated by the MINDO/3 method. To account for the through-space interactions between the triple bonds we have assumed an exponential dependence of the matrix elementwhere d denotes the (mean) distance between the -bondsderived from MNDO calculations or, if available, X-ray data (see Table I). The cross terms of eqs 3-5 have been adjusted in order to reproduce the experimental data. The out-of-plane  orbitalshave not been included since in this simple approach their energies vary only if hyperconjugation with the adjacent C-H bonds is also considered.",
        "The results of the calculations are given in Table II. Although this procedure neglects the hydrogen atoms as well as the indi-vidual molecular geometry, the good agreement between the calculated and experimental values shows that the complex in-terplay of through-space and through-bond effects can be explained qualitatively on this level.24In addition to the empirical method, we have used the MIN-DO/3 procedure,178 which has proven quite reliable in predicting PE bands of many unsaturated hydrocarbons. Studies on 1 have revealed4 that the ethano bridges cause a sequence *above  ~,opposite to the ordering that is expected solely from through-space interaction. This sequence has been ascribed to a strong interaction between +and the  -skeleton.In 2 on the other hand, the sequence \"on top of  ,+is predicted.5 Here the propano bridge interacts strongly with  \"and thus reinforces the through-space ordering.",
        "To correlate the superimposed effects in these systems we have divided the nine diacetylenes into two groups (see Figure 3a,b). The criterion imposed is the length of the methylene chain relevant to the discussion, which is always drawn on the left-hand side of the depicted formula (we will concentrate on  =2 and  =3 and consider the larger butano or pentano bridges as relatively ineffective for through-bond interaction; for the justification of this assumption, see below). The cycles containing an even-numbered n have been collected in Figure 3a and those with an odd-numbered n in Figure 3b.",
        "This classification lets us distinguish a number of effects. (1) The effect of transannular overlap is nicely accounted for by the exponential decline of the relative split assigned to the out-of-plane orbitals. Starting at 1 with a strong split,  ( 0+/ 0~)= 0.9 eV, this difference is reduced to =0.3 eV in 2 and remains at about 0.25 eV in all larger rings. For instance, the spectrum of 1,7-cyclododecadiyne (8) is more or less identical with that of the next higher symmetrical homologue, 1,8-cyclotetradecadiyne (9) (/vj = 9.07 and 9.34 eV). Thus, we conclude that a transannular distance of d = 3 Á or less is necessary to induce through-space interaction.",
        "(2) As is evident from the two figures, the ethano bridge (Figure 3a) leads to an overall more closely spaced band structure, which can be traced back to destabilization of the  *orbital while the wf combination remains unaffected.

        "through spoce, C2H, CjH, hyperconjugation and inductive effects c cFigure 4. The interplay of through-space and through-bond effects leading to the observed band structure in 3. with a propano bridge (Figure 3b) show one band at an energy below /vj = 9 eV, which, according to the calculations, is due to an ionization event from the ir¡~ combination. The virtually identical PE spectra of 4 and 5 as well as those of 6 and 7 confirm our assumption that the butano or pentano bridges do not influence the ordering of the four highest occupied MO’s to any extent and justify our classification (« = 2 or  =3) as shown in Figure 3a,b. An explanation for this behavior can be traced back to the fact that the longer methylene chains contain a large number ofCarbocyclic Diacetylenes J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 113. No. 24. 1991 9263fragment a orbitals that belong to different symmetry groups and thus allow for interaction with both the bonding and the anti-bonding combinations of theorbitals.(3) 1,5-Cyclononadiyne (3) is represented in both figures. Here the effects of both bridges are competing with each other. Through-space interaction, inductive effect, and hyperconjugation place ir¡+ below irf and  0+below irf (see left of Figure 4). Interaction with the C2H4 bridge moves ir¡+ on top of  0+,leaving the other levels unchanged (middle of Figure 4). The propano bridge on the other hand only destabilizes irf (/„j = 8.85 eV), and thus the sequence shown on the right of Figure 4 is obtained.",
        "(4) From the above discussion, a picture emerges that indicates that if an ethano or propano bridge is present, through-bond interaction will dominate through-space interaction even though the latter should be substantial because of the small transannular distance. This effect is especially pronounced in 1,5-cyclooctadiyne (1). According to our calculations, in this case the strong through-space interaction caused by the small transannular dis-tance (d = 2.56 Á) is overruled by through-bond interaction with the ethano bridge. Thus, we conclude that the natural orbital sequence in 1 is reversed (see Figure 3a), and the bonding  +combination lies at lower ionization energy than its antibonding irf counterpart (for a different interpretation, see ref 4). For larger rings neither effect plays an important part in the relative order of the-MO’s.(5) It is difficult to rationalize the result that the MINDO/3 procedure calculates the antibonding irf combination to be at higher orbital energy than the bonding 0+combination for all even-numbered n. For odd n the natural order ( 0+below irf) also varies strongly (see Table II). Thus the assignments of these MO’s have been made only tentatively. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the ordering of the ir-N~ levels when com-paring the results obtained for 4, 5, and 8 (see Table II). While the semiempirical calculations predict *to be at lower orbital energy than irf (strong influence of the ethano or butano bridge), the LCFO analysis comes to the opposite conclusion ( *at higher energy, i.e., natural order). In Figure 3a we have assigned the bands from the results of the latter procedure.",
        "(6) If reaction with an electrophile at the triple bonds of the discussed compounds is primarily influenced by the HOMO/ LUMO interaction, then only 2, and to a lesser extent 6 and 7, should show a pronounced differentiation concerning the direction of attack of the incoming electrophile. In these cases, the HOMO is of the in-plane type and lies at exceptionally high values as compared to the remaining p orbital combinations (the HOMO energy is separated by 0.65 eV (2), 0.37 eV (6), and 0.33 eV (7) from the remaining bands). All other compounds show a relatively close spacing of MO energies, and consequently any selectivity based on the MO sequence alone is more than questionable. On top of the electronic effects, one must consider steric restraints imposed by the length of the connecting moieties, which will direct the mode of reaction irrespective of any electronic contributions. To study these influences we are currently investigating the re-action of a number of electrophiles with 2-8. ConclusionsWe have presented two complementary methods to prepare medium-sized cyclic diacetylenes. For 1-5 we have found a correlation between the angle at the sp center next to the ethano bridge and the 13C shift of this C atom. The PE spectroscopic investigations reveal a strong splitting of the in-plane -bandsin the cases of 2, 3, and 6, i.e., in those molecules where at least one propano group connects the two acetylene moieties. Our inves-tigations furthermore show that the ethano and butano bridges lead to a small splitting between the  -bands.Experimental SectionPreparation of the Bissemicarbazones 18 and 23.
