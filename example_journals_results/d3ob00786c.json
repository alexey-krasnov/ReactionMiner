Sridhar b and B. V. Subba Reddy *a,c Rhodium(III)-catalyzed [3 + 2]-spiroannulation of 2-aryl-1,4-benzoxazines with 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoates has been developed for the synthesis of highly rigid spirolactones in good yields with high regioselectivity. The reaction proceeds through a cascade of C–H activation followed by C–H annulation and lactoniza-tion. In this approach, two C–C and C–O bonds are formed in a single step. This is the first report on the spiroannulation of 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazines with 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoates. Introduction Transition metal catalyzed annulation is a powerful strategy in organic synthesis to construct various polycyclic scaffolds. Recently, numerous transition metal catalytic systems have been developed to facilitate C–H activation without pre-functionalization of the substrates.1 Among them, rhodium(III) plays a distinctive role in the C–H activation/functionalization of diverse aromatic systems to generate several fused-/spiro-cyclic frameworks, which are frequently found in many biologi-cally active natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuti-cally active ingredients.2 In particular, Rh-catalyzed inter-molecular [3 + 2] annulations are useful to generate diverse scaffolds.3 On the other hand, 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazine motifs are frequently found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, which are known to exhibit potent biological activities such as antihyperlipidemic, anti-arrhythmic and antithrombotic activi-ties, etc.4 As shown in Fig. 1, spiroindanes play a significant role in medicinal chemistry.5 Consequently, a few [3 + 2] cyclo-addition reactions of 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazines with different unsaturated substrates have been developed to produce spiro-frameworks using transition metal catalysts.6 For example, the spiroannulation of 2-aryl-1,4-benzoxazines with alkynes has been reported to produce spiroindane derivatives.7,8 Recently, the C–H functionalization of cyclic ketimines with alkynyl chlorides has also been reported using the Rh(III)Cu(OAc)2 metal complex (Scheme 1). 9 Results and discussion Following our interest in transition metal catalyzed C–H functionalization,10 we herein report a simple and efficient cascade process for the construction of highly rigid spiroin-dane derivatives through sequential C–H annulation and lacto-nization. The required precursors, 2-arylbenzoxazines and hydroxy-alkynoates, were prepared according to literature procedures. Initially, we attempted the C–H annulation of 2-phenylben-zoxazine (1a) with ethyl 4-hydroxyl-4-methyl-2-pentynoate (2a) using a Rh(III) catalyst in the presence of different bases like NaOAc, KOAc, and K2CO3 in various solvents such as THF, TFE, DCE, EtOH, and CH3CN at different temperatures (Table 1). The reaction proceeds smoothly at 80 °C in the pres-ence of NaOAc in trifluoroethanol (entry 1, Table 1). Other metal catalysts such as Ru(II) and Pd(II) salts failed to give the desired product (entries 2 and 3, Table 1). As with NaOAc, the reaction was quite successful with KOAc (entry 4, Table 1). However, the reaction was unsuccessful in the presence of other bases such as K2CO3 (entry 5, Table 1). Other solvents such as DCE, EtOH, and CH3CN were found to be ineffective (entries 6–8, Table 1). The reaction did not proceed at 25 °C (entry 9, Table 1). The reaction was sluggish even at 50 °C (entry 10, Table 1). The above results prompted us to examine the scope of this method (entry 1, Table 1); the scope of this method is exempli-fied with different substrates. Interestingly, various benzoxa-zines with substituents at the C2 and C3 positions on the phenyl ring participated well in this transformation (3a–s). The substituents present on the aromatic ring showed some effect on the conversion. As shown in Table 2, the presence of elec-tron donating groups on both C2 and C3 rings (3b, 3c, 3i, and 3j) afforded the desired spiro-products in excellent yields. However, the substrates bearing electron-withdrawing substitu-ents on the aryl ring gave the product in a moderate yield (3d, Table 2) compared to the halides (3e, 3f, 3g, 3h, 3k, 3l, and 3m, Table 2). The alkyl chain did not influence the yield of this reaction. For example, no significant difference in yield was observed either with i-butyl (2b) or n-propyl (2c) substi-tuted alkynoates (3n and 3o, Table 2). However, no reaction was observed with hydroxy alkynoate (2d) which is derived from β-tetralone due to its steric hindrance (3p, Table 2). This method was further extended to other hydroxy alkynoates (2e and 2f ) prepared from cyclopropyl ketone and cyclobutanone, respectively. Interestingly, the desired products (3q and 3r) were obtained in 79–80% yields under the present reaction conditions. To our surprise, the hydroxyl propiolate (2g) pre-pared from acetophenone failed to give the desired product. The structure of 3f was further confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis (Fig. 2). The scope of this method is further extended to substituted 4-hydroxy-alkynoates (Table 3). It is worth mentioning that both acyclic and cyclic alkynoates actively participated in this transformation. The reactivity of propiolates having a cyclic ring such as cyclopentyl (2h), cyclohexyl (2i), cycloheptyl (2j), and cyclooctyl (2k) was examined. The spiroannulation was quite successful with these cycloalkyl propiolates without any significant difference in the activity, affording dispiro-frame-works in good yields (5a–p, Table 3). Furthermore, 3,4-dichlor-ophenyl and p-tolylbenzoxazines also gave the spiro-com-pounds in good yields (entries 5n and 5o, Table 3). Based on the above control experiments and previous reports,6 we proposed a plausible mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2. Initially, active monomeric rhodium species are generated from [Cp*RhCl2]2 and sodium acetate, which acti-vate the C–H bond of 3-phenyl-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine to give the rhodacycle A. Subsequent π-complexation of hydroxy-alkynoate with metallocycle A generates the ternary complex B. An oxidative insertion of hydroxy-alkynoate into the rhodium– carbon bond of the phenyl ring provides the rhodium complex C. An intramolecular addition of alkenyl rhodium to imine generates intermediate D. Proto-derhodation and successive lactonization of D would give the desired product 3a. Furthermore, we studied the reactivity of other substrates such as 2-phenylquinoxaline (1b) and 3-phenyl-[1,4]thiazine (1c) with 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoate (2a) under the optimized reac-tion conditions. Unfortunately, the reaction did not proceed with these substrates and the starting materials were recov-ered. Similarly, 2-thienyl-and 2-pyridyl substituted benzo [b][1,4]oxazines (1d and 1e) also failed to give the desired pro-ducts. Moreover, the reaction of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol (2b) also failed to give the desired product (Scheme 3). Besides, the reaction did not proceed with terminal alkynol (2l) and the acetyl derivative of alkynoate (2m). Interestingly, other alkyne derivatives such as ethyl 3-phenylpropiolate and 3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (2n and 2o) gave the annulated products (5q and 5r) in good yields. The feasibility of the current strategy was checked on the gram scale. The reaction was performed on the 1 g scale under the present reaction conditions. The desired product 3a was obtained in 80% yield, as shown in Scheme 4. The product was further derivatized by different functional group transformations such as Sonogashira coupling and the lactone was converted into thiolactone using Lawesson’s reagent. As shown in Scheme 5, the spiro-compound 5k was treated with phenylacetylene under Sonogashira conditions to produce the corresponding product 5k′ in 86% yield. In another experiment, product 3a was treated with Lawesson’s reagent to produce thiolactone 3a′ in 84% yield (Scheme 5). Conclusions In summary, we have developed a novel Rh(III)-catalyzed spir-oannulation of substituted 1,4-benzoxazines with 4-hydroxy-2-pentynoates to produce the corresponding spirolactones in good yields and high regioselectivity. A large number of diverse spirolactones were prepared by means of a sequential C–H annulation and lactonization reaction. This method pro-vides direct access to pharmaceutically relevant spiroindane scaffolds from readily available 2-aryl benzoxazines and hydroxyalkynoates.

        "Rh(III)-catalyzed [3 + 2] spiroannulation of 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazines with 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoates through ortho-C–H bond functionalization†Kommu Nagesh,a,c Jagadish Manda,a,c B. Sridhar b and B. V. Subba Reddy *a,cRhodium(III)-catalyzed [3 + 2]-spiroannulation of 2-aryl-1,4-benzoxazines with 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoates has been developed for the synthesis of highly rigid spirolactones in good yields with high regioselectivity. The reaction proceeds through a cascade of C–H activation followed by C–H annulation and lactoniza-tion. In this approach, two C–C and C–O bonds are formed in a single step. This is the first report on the spiroannulation of 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazines with 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoates.",
        "Transition metal catalyzed annulation is a powerful strategy in organic synthesis to construct various polycyclic scaffolds. Recently, numerous transition metal catalytic systems have been developed to facilitate C–H activation without pre-functionalization of the substrates.1 Among them, rhodium(III) plays a distinctive role in the C–H activation/functionalization of diverse aromatic systems to generate several fused-/spiro-cyclic frameworks, which are frequently found in many biologi-cally active natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuti-cally active ingredients.2 In particular, Rh-catalyzed inter-molecular [3 + 2] annulations are useful to generate diverse scaffolds.3On the other hand, 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazine motifs are frequently found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, which are known to exhibit potent biological activities such as antihyperlipidemic, anti-arrhythmic and antithrombotic activi-ties, etc.4 As shown in Fig. 1, spiroindanes play a significant role in medicinal chemistry.5 Consequently, a few [3 + 2] cyclo-addition reactions of 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxazines with different unsaturated substrates have been developed to produce spiro-frameworks using transition metal catalysts.6 For example, the spiroannulation of 2-aryl-1,4-benzoxazineswith alkynes has been reported to produce spiroindane derivatives.7,8 Recently, the C–H functionalization of cyclic ketimines with alkynyl chlorides has also been reported using the Rh(III)Cu(OAc)2 metal complex (Scheme 1). 9Following our interest in transition metal catalyzed C–H functionalization,10 we herein report a simple and efficient cascade process for the construction of highly rigid spiroin-dane derivatives through sequential C–H annulation and lacto-nization. The required precursors, 2-arylbenzoxazines and hydroxy-alkynoates, were prepared according to literature procedures. Initially, we attempted the C–H annulation of 2-phenylben-zoxazine (1a) with ethyl 4-hydroxyl-4-methyl-2-pentynoate (2a) using a Rh(III) catalyst in the presence of different bases like NaOAc, KOAc, and K2CO3 in various solvents such as THF, TFE, DCE, EtOH, and CH3CN at different temperatures(Table 1). The reaction proceeds smoothly at 80 °C in the pres-ence of NaOAc in trifluoroethanol (entry 1, Table 1). Other metal catalysts such as Ru(II) and Pd(II) salts failed to give the desired product (entries 2 and 3, Table 1). As with NaOAc, the reaction was quite successful with KOAc (entry 4, Table 1). However, the reaction was unsuccessful in the presence of other bases such as K2CO3 (entry 5, Table 1). Other solvents such as DCE, EtOH, and CH3CN were found to be ineffective (entries 6–8, Table 1). The reaction did not proceed at 25 °C (entry 9, Table 1). The reaction was sluggish even at 50 °C (entry 10, Table 1).",
        "The above results prompted us to examine the scope of this method (entry 1, Table 1); the scope of this method is exempli-fied with different substrates. Interestingly, various benzoxa-zines with substituents at the C2 and C3 positions on the phenyl ring participated well in this transformation (3a–s). The substituents present on the aromatic ring showed some effecton the conversion. As shown in Table 2, the presence of elec-tron donating groups on both C2 and C3 rings (3b, 3c, 3i, and 3j) afforded the desired spiro-products in excellent yields. However, the substrates bearing electron-withdrawing substitu-ents on the aryl ring gave the product in a moderate yield (3d, Table 2) compared to the halides (3e, 3f, 3g, 3h, 3k, 3l, and 3m, Table 2). The alkyl chain did not influence the yield of this reaction. For example, no significant difference in yield was observed either with i-butyl (2b) or n-propyl (2c) substi-tuted alkynoates (3n and 3o, Table 2). However, no reaction was observed with hydroxy alkynoate (2d) which is derived from β-tetralone due to its steric hindrance (3p, Table 2). Thismethod was further extended to other hydroxy alkynoates (2e and 2f ) prepared from cyclopropyl ketone and cyclobutanone, respectively. Interestingly, the desired products (3q and 3r) were obtained in 79–80% yields under the present reaction conditions. To our surprise, the hydroxyl propiolate (2g) pre-pared from acetophenone failed to give the desired product.",
        "The structure of 3f was further confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis (Fig. 2).",
        "The scope of this method is further extended to substituted 4-hydroxy-alkynoates (Table 3). It is worth mentioning that both acyclic and cyclic alkynoates actively participated in this transformation. The reactivity of propiolates having a cyclic ring such as cyclopentyl (2h), cyclohexyl (2i), cycloheptyl (2j), and cyclooctyl (2k) was examined. The spiroannulation was quite successful with these cycloalkyl propiolates without any significant difference in the activity, affording dispiro-frame-works in good yields (5a–p, Table 3). Furthermore, 3,4-dichlor-ophenyl and p-tolylbenzoxazines also gave the spiro-com-pounds in good yields (entries 5n and 5o, Table 3).",
        "Based on the above control experiments and previous reports,6 we proposed a plausible mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2. Initially, active monomeric rhodium species are generated from [Cp*RhCl2]2 and sodium acetate, which acti-vate the C–H bond of 3-phenyl-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine to give the rhodacycle A. Subsequent π-complexation of hydroxy-alkynoate with metallocycle A generates the ternary complex B. An oxidative insertion of hydroxy-alkynoate into the rhodium– carbon bond of the phenyl ring provides the rhodium complex C. An intramolecular addition of alkenyl rhodium to imine generates intermediate D. Proto-derhodation and successive lactonization of D would give the desired product 3a. Furthermore, we studied the reactivity of other substrates such as 2-phenylquinoxaline (1b) and 3-phenyl-[1,4]thiazine (1c) with 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoate (2a) under the optimized reac-tion conditions. Unfortunately, the reaction did not proceed with these substrates and the starting materials were recov-ered. Similarly, 2-thienyl-and 2-pyridyl substituted benzo [b][1,4]oxazines (1d and 1e) also failed to give the desired pro-ducts. Moreover, the reaction of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol (2b) also failed to give the desired product (Scheme 3). Besides, the reaction did not proceed with terminal alkynol (2l) and the acetyl derivative of alkynoate (2m). Interestingly, other alkyne derivatives such as ethyl 3-phenylpropiolate and 3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ol (2n and 2o) gave the annulated products (5q and 5r) in good yields. The feasibility of the current strategy was checked on the gram scale. The reaction was performed on the 1 g scale under the present reaction conditions. The desired product 3a was obtained in 80% yield, as shown in Scheme 4. The product was further derivatized by different functional group transformations such as Sonogashira coupling and the lactone was converted into thiolactone using Lawesson’s reagent. As shown in Scheme 5, the spiro-compound 5k was treated with phenylacetylene under Sonogashira conditions toproduce the corresponding product 5k′ in 86% yield. In another experiment, product 3a was treated with Lawesson’s reagent to produce thiolactone 3a′ in 84% yield (Scheme 5).",
        "In summary, we have developed a novel Rh(III)-catalyzed spir-oannulation of substituted 1,4-benzoxazines with 4-hydroxy-2-pentynoates to produce the corresponding spirolactones in good yields and high regioselectivity.
