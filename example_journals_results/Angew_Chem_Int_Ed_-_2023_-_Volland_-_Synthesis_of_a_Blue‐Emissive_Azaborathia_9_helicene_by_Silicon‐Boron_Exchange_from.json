Geppert, Martijn J. Wildervanck, Felix Full, and Agnieszka Nowak-Król* Abstract: We report the concise synthesis and chir-(optical) properties of an azaborathia[9]helicene consist-ing of two thienoazaborole motifs. The key intermedi-ate, a highly congested teraryl with nearly parallel isoquinoline moieties, was generated as a mixture of atropisomers upon fusion of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothiophene moiety. These diastereomers were characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis revealing intriguing interactions in the solid state. Subsequent insertion of boron into the aromatic scaffold via silicon-boron exchange involving triisopropylsilyl groups fixed the helical geometry, thereby establishing a novel method for the preparation of azaboroles. The ligand exchange at boron in the final step afforded the blue emitter displaying a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 and excellent configurational stability. Detailed structural and theoretical investigation of unusual atropisomers and the helicene provide insights into their isomerization processes. Introduction Helicenes, defined by IUPAC as ortho-fused polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds in which all rings (minimum five) are angularly arranged,[1] adopt an aesthetic non-planar screw-shaped geometry. The scientific interest in such systems primarily manifests from their unique elec-tronic properties emerging from the combination of their inherent helical chirality and the extended aromatic scaffold.[2] This results in appreciable chiral responses, e.g. high values of optical rotation (OR) and the emergence of circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).[3] Hence, their areas of use span from ligands in asymmetric catalysis[4] and biological systems (DNA-binding),[5] over nanocages[6] to semiconductors[7] and CPL-materials, e.g. light-emitting diodes.[8] Furthermore, since the discovery of chiral-induced spin selectivity,[9] chiral molecules are of interest for the potential embedment in spintronic devices.[10] This versatile range of applications is owed to the tunability of helicenes’ properties, which can be adjusted by a series of architectural acts, such as heteroatom-doping within the helical framework,[11] e.g. Lewis acidic boron with an empty pz-orbital can be introduced into the aromatic scaffold at strategic positions[12] and stabilized by an adjacent [*] D.

We demonstrated this for azabora[7]helicenes B, whose Φfl along with absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors could be further enhanced by lateral extension.[16] The effect of a B !N dative bond can be amplified by the introduction of additional azaborole rings, as observed for single and double [6]-or [5]helicenes D–F bearing two boron centers, though all these compounds feature low configurational stability.[16a,17] As opposed to borahelicenes, the Φfl values of thiophene-containing congeners are usually extremely low. Effective strategies to improve their emissive properties is lateral extension to produce push-pull systems,[18] and oxidation of thiophene to the corresponding sulfone.[19] Thiophene is widely used in organic semiconductors, such as conductive polymers poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).[20] The beneficial features of embedding thiophene are twofold. Firstly, its predictable reactivity difference at the 2-and 3-positions opens up the possibility for regioselective synthetic functionalizations. Secondly, the optoelectronic properties of thiahelicenes can be further altered via inter-and intra-molecular chalcogen-chalcogen interactions involving sulfur atoms,[21] which facilitate favorable packing arrangements in the solid state, essential for the charge carrier transport. Since the seminal work by Wynberg, a wealth of thiahelicenes have been reported, including those composed of alternating benzene and thiophene rings (e.g. H),[22] or their combination with cyclopentadiene and other heteroles, such as phosphole and pyrrole (compounds I).[23] Only recently, Licandro and Wagner reported a similar thiaheli-cene system where two benzene rings were replaced with 1,2-oxaborinine heterocycles (helicene C).[24] This variety of thiahelicenes concludes with an extraordinary subclass of molecules assembled from angularly fused thiophene rings (e.g. G).[25] A positive effect of azaborole on the emission features of π-conjugated scaffolds and an abundance of thiophene-based semiconductors with highly aligned molecular arrays in the solid state prompted us to design azaborathia-[9]helicene H1-R4, the first helicene consisting of azaborole and thiophene. The ring combination present in this system, where a B !N bond and a sulfur atom are on the same edge of the molecule, is scarce in the literature, presumably due to synthetic challenges and a higher liability of boron-nitrogen bonding when compared to thieno[3,2-c]-[1,2]azaborole derivatives with an inverted thiophene ring. To our knowledge, there are only two small molecules with a thieno[2,3-c][1,2]azaborole structural motif.[26] We also report an entirely new method for the preparation of azaboroles, based on silicon-boron exchange that we have developed to synthesize this unique chiral system as well as its unusual highly congested atropisomeric teraryl precur-sors. Results and Discussion Synthesis The modular approach we proposed for the construction of azaborole-containing helicenes B and E[16a] is built on the basis of the coupling between small building blocks to afford either bi-or oligoaryls, followed by a subsequent borylation reaction, which fixes the helical conformation. Due to the straightforward execution, this approach appeared to be suitable to synthesize helicene H1. The key intermediate in this route is diborylated dithienothiophene (DTT) DTT-(Bpin)2. This compound is required for the subsequent cross-coupling with commercially available IQ-Cl to provide teraryl TA. (Scheme S2, Supporting Information). However, attempts at its synthesis from brominated congener DTT-Br2 [27] via Miyaura borylation with B2pin2 using either Pd2(dba)3/XPhos or Pd(dppf)Cl2 in the presence of KOAc were unsuccessful. Retrosynthetic analysis allowed us to design an alternative route in which the molecule was disconnected so as to form the CNone C bond between the two thiophene rings at a later stage of the synthetic sequence (Scheme 1). This strategy required the installation of both isoquinoline (IQ) moieties prior to the fusion of the central thiophene ring of the DTT moiety. The synthesis started with the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling between IQ-Cl and Th-Bpin to obtain biaryl BA in a very good yield of 92%. The introduction of a triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group to block the reactive α-position of the thiophene ring adjacent to the IQ residue provided BA-TIPS in a 63% yield. Its subsequent coupling with bis(phenylsulfonyl)sulfide[27] gave rise to oligoarylic intermediate OA-TIPS2 in a yield of 80%. In the next step, we tested the conditions for the ring-closing reaction. However, neither photoreaction nor oxidative coupling with FeCl3, FeClO4, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ), or CuOAc2 allowed for the success-ful synthesis of the target compound. We then carried out a Pd-catalyzed dual CNone H activation reaction. The original conditions, as reported by Che et al.,[28] using Pd(OAc)2, AgOAc, Na2CO3 and pivalic acid as the solvent, provided the desired compound, although only in trace amounts. To improve the reaction efficiency and ensure its reproducibil-ity, we screened the conditions varying catalyst salts, loadings, oxidant, solvent mixtures and reaction times (Table S1, Supporting Information). During these studies we isolated two fractions. While both ESI mass spectra revealed peaks at m/z�763.31, the corresponding 1H NMR spectra differed significantly (see structural investigation below) indicating the formation of isomers. In fact, the steric clash generated by two TIPS groups and two IQ moieties in close proximity produced atropisomers, i.e., a pair of enantiomers and a meso-compound. Due to the significant difference in their polarity, the diastereomers could be readily separated via standard column or flash chromatography. Finally, the optimal conditions were identified for the reaction of OA-Angewandte ChemieResearch Articles Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, 62, e202304291 (2 of 10) © 2023 The Authors.

Given the enormous steric congestion produced by the four bulky substituents around the two CNone C single bonds, this result was highly satisfactory. Initially, we also used trimeth-ylsilyl-protected precursors in this synthetic sequence (for details, see Supporting Information). However, the TMS groups proved too labile preventing chemoselective fusion of the two thiophene rings. As revealed by the single crystal X-ray analysis (see below), the first fraction corresponded to the racemate, while the second to the meso-compound. This assignment is in line with their relative polarity. The nitrogen atoms in the enantiomers point in the opposite directions resulting in a low dipole moment (2.7 D), as indicated by DFT calcula-tions (B3LYP[29]-D3(BJ)[30]/def2-SVP[31]), due to the cancel-lation of the two opposite effects of each IQ moiety. In contrast, the nitrogen atoms in the meso-compound are located on the same face of the DTT plane. This spatial arrangement gives rise to a higher dipole moment (5.2 D) than that of the enantiomers, consequently facilitating the separation of rac-TA-TIPS2 from the meso-form. On the other hand, despite testing different chiral columns and solvent mixtures we were not able to resolve the (Ra,Ra)-from the (Sa,Sa)-enantiomers by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Table S13, Supporting Informa-tion). In the next step, the TIPS groups were cleaved with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to afford TA (depro-tection route) in a yield of 83%. This reaction was followed by electrophilic borylation of the thiophene α-position with boron tribromide in the presence of the Hünig’s base under modified Murakami’s conditions.[16a,32] The intermediate bromide-substituted azaborole was not isolated due to its low solubility but reacted directly with trimethylaluminum to afford target H1-Me4 in a yield below 5% over two steps. The low efficiency of this reaction is in stark contrast to the analogous generation of helicenes via borylation of carbocy-clic rings. This unsatisfactory result and a cumbersome purification of TA due to the residual TBA salts prompted us to reevaluate our synthetic protocol. Accordingly, we subjected TA-TIPS2 directly to a reaction (direct method) with BBr3 in the absence of the Hünig’s base. Noteworthy, such silicon-boron exchange reactions are unprecedented in the chemistry of azaboroles. After 6 h the volatiles were removed and the bromide complex was submitted to the next reaction without any further purification. The synthesis was accomplished via the ligand exchange at the boron atoms to afford H1-Me4 in a yield of 42%. We wondered whether the orientation of the IQ moieties in TA-TIPS2 affects the tendency of the compound to form the helicene. The alignment of the IQs in the enantiomers mirrors that in the target compound and hence, the closure of the azaborole rings could be, in principle, more feasible. To verify this hypothesis, we reacted the isomeric fractions independently with BBr3 affording the target helicene in similar and reproducible yields. This indicates the comparable reactiv-ities of all stereoisomers towards BBr3 under our conditions. Additionally, we tested the use of boron trichloride in this transformation. To our delight, the borylation, followed by the analogous ligand exchange protocol, provided H1-Me4 in a satisfactory yield of 45%. Even though silicon-boron exchange reactions are widely reported in the literature for the preparation of a plethora of oligomers, polymers and boron containing heterocycles,[33] all these methods utilize TMS groups. To our knowledge, this is the first case of silicon-boron exchange involving the more robust and bulky TIPS groups in combination with BBr3 or BCl3. Structural Investigations The target compound and nearly all intermediates of the synthesis, in addition to the TMS derivatives, were charac-terized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 2 and Supporting Information).[34] The ring-closing reaction produced isomers TA-TIPS2 with a fixed mutual orientation of both IQ substituents, as revealed by their solid-state structures. Single crystals of both fractions were grown from solutions of chloroform by vapor diffusion with n-hexane. The first fraction, identified as a racemate, crystallized in the P21/n space group. The unit cell contains two pairs of the (Ra,Ra)-and (Sa,Sa)-isomers, that are distinguished by the nitrogen atoms of the IQ-moieties facing away from each other (Figure 2a). This leads to the overlap of only pyridine rings with a distance of 3.38– 3.39 Å. meso-TA-TIPS2 crystallized in the P-1 space group. As opposed to the enantiomers, the IQ residues of the meso-compound are cofacially stacked with the nitrogen atoms facing the same direction (Figure 2b). This orientation results in the full overlap of both IQ moieties. The distance determined between these substituents was 3.30–3.34 Å. In all diastereomers, the IQ residues are essentially parallel to each other. Accordingly, the dihedral angles between the mean planes of the pyridine rings were measured to be 4.8° and 2.4° for the racemate and the meso-compound, respec-tively. Moreover, the angles between the DTT and IQ mean planes are 77.6° and 75.9° for meso-TA-TIPS2 and 75.4° for the enantiomers, pointing out that the IQ substituents are strongly tilted versus the DTT central unit. The bulky groups effectively prevent π–π interactions between the DTT moieties. Interestingly, four complementary CNone H···N hydrogen bonds were visible between two neighboring molecules of meso-TA-TIPS2 (Figure 2e), while these inter-actions were absent in the packing arrangement of rac-TA-TIPS2. The hindered rotation of the IQ moieties in isomeric TA-TIPS2 was also confirmed by sharp, well-resolved 1H NMR spectra in CD2Cl2 at 298 K (Figure 3a,b). Unequal alignment of the IQ moieties results in clear differences in the chemical shifts of the corresponding signals, particularly in the aromatic region. All signals were unequivocally assigned based on the 2D NMR spectra (Figures S24–S27, Supporting Information). The most significant difference was observed for proton H1 of the pyridine ring. This proton was ascribed to a doublet at δ=7.21 ppm with a coupling constant J=5.6 Hz in the spectrum of the racemate, while the corresponding signal for the meso-compound (J=5.7 Hz) was downfield-shifted to δ=8.04 ppm. On the other hand, a doublet of doublet of doublets at δ=6.76 ppm in the spectrum of meso-TA-TIPS2 was assigned to H5, while it was downfield-shifted (δ= 7.32 ppm) for rac-TA-TIPS2. The high steric hindrance endowed the compounds with significant configurational stability, even when compared to BINOL (ΔG‡en=37.7 kcalmoNone 1).[35] DFT calculations (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP) indicated that the meso-form (Ra,Sa) is 6.7 kcalmol None 1 higher in energy than the enantiom-ers (Figures 4b and S44a, Supporting Information). This could be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the two nitrogen atoms of both IQ moieties being in close proximity in the meso-compound. Moreover, conversion of the thermodynamically preferred enantiomer into the meso-form would require overcoming a barrier of 36.1 kcalmolNone 1, while the reverse process (the meso-to-enantiomer inver-sion) is associated with the barrier of 29.4 kcalmolNone 1 (Fig-ure 4b). Noteworthy, the process is extremely complex due to high conformational freedom, involving rotation of the IQ residues around the CNone C bonds and the TIPS groups (see Supporting Information). To determine the conversion of the meso-compound into the enantiomers, the sample of energetically less preferred meso-TA-TIPS2 was heated at 120 °C and the decreasing integration of the meso-form was monitored by HPLC. Due to the significant difference in their thermodynamic stabilities, the reverse reaction was neglected and the diastereomerization process was approxi-mated with first-order kinetics[36] (see Supporting Informa-tion). The estimated ΔG‡diast value of 30.8 kcalmolNone 1 is in fair agreement with our theoretical studies. Cleavage of the silyl groups with TBAF in either isomer led to TA, which showed significantly broadened signals in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum in CD2Cl2 at 298 K due to the now freely but slowly rotating IQ residues. The dynamic behavior of this compound was studied by variable-temperature (VT)-1H NMR spectroscopy in CD2Cl2 (Figure 3c). The lowering of the temperature resulted in a gradual sharpening of the signals with the coalescence temperature of ca. 280 K. The measurements at temper-atures of 253 K and lower yielded resolved and sharp proton signals, indicating hindered rotation of the IQ moieties of TA on the NMR time scale. Therefore, analogously to the TIPS-protected compounds, atropisomers can be distin-guished under these conditions. This explains the second set of proton signals in the 1H NMR spectrum that developed stepwise between 283 K and 233 K. The two species are present in a ratio of �3.6 : 1 (22% of the meso-compound). According to DFT calculations (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP) the (Ra,Ra)-and (Sa,Sa)-TA are 0.7 kcalmol None 1 energetically more preferable than the corresponding meso-compound (Figure 4a). A calculation for a chemical equilibrium between two species, the enantiomer and the meso-form, suggests that the lower energy conformation would be adapted by 23% of the overall population of molecules in solution at room temperature. This is in excellent agreement with the results of VT NMR spectroscopy. However, the interconversion of the more stable species into another diastereomer requires relatively low energy so that the process is rapid at room temperature. The experimental ΔG‡diast value for the interconversion barrier, determined by dynamic NMR spectroscopy, is ca. 15 kcalmolNone 1 (Table S14, Supporting Information). This result is consistent with our DFT calculations. In principle, rotation of IQ residues in TA can proceed in either direction due to the rotational freedom around the CNone C bonds. This gives rise to three distinct interconversion pathways via transition states with a) both nitrogen atoms pointing inward, b) one nitrogen pointing inward and one pointing outward and c) both nitrogen atoms pointing outward as a rate-determining step (RDS) (Figure 4a and Figure S43, Supporting Information). The most feasible interconversion pathway is the one in which the IQ pyridine rings are tilted toward each other (pathway a). The RDS is preceded by conformational changes of the enantiomeric species, where (Sa,Sa)-TA-C1 is lower in energy by 2.5 kcalmolNone 1 than (Sa,Sa)-TA-C2 with the IQ residues more strongly bent out of the DTT mean plane. The degree of distortion in both molecules can be illustrated by the torsion angle ∡(CIQ1-CTh1-CTh2-CIQ2) (ψ) (cf. Figure 2c) that is measured as 17.8° and 30.5° for (Sa,Sa)-TA-C1 and -C2 (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP, gas phase), respectively. Interestingly, the latter conformation is even higher in energy than the meso-form. The crystals of TA, obtained by recrystallization from CH2Cl2 and pentane (P-1 space group), consisted exclusively of (Ra,Ra)-and (Sa,Sa)-enantiomers (Figure 2c). With angle ψ of 34.3°, they resemble conformation (Sa,Sa)-TA-C2 rather than the global minima obtained by DFT calculations. This is not an unusual situation for the solid state structures, as shown by a systematic analysis of an extensive number of single crystals by Pascal[37] and revealed in studies of warped molecules.[38] The molecule is significantly more distorted than the TIPS derivative as torsion angle ψ in the enantiomer of the latter compound (solid-state structure) was only 3.8° (Figure 2a), that is, by ca. 30° lower than in TA. A larger conformational space in TA is reflected by the smaller dihedral angles (58.0°) between the DTT and IQ mean planes, while the two IQ moieties remain nearly parallel (a dihedral angle of 7.8°). The absence of the TIPS groups enabled intermolecular π-π interactions. The distance between IQ moieties of the neighboring TA molecules in a homochiral stack is ca. 3.5 Å. This stack is interacting with adjacent stacks of the other enantiomer via CNone H···π hydro-gen bonds. The crystals of rac-H1-Me4 were grown via diffusion of n-hexane into a solution of chloroform. The compound crystallized in the P-1 space group. The BNone N bond lengths in the two azaborole rings were measured as 1.631(4) and 1.638(6) Å implying strong Lewis pair interactions, which is in agreement with a 11B NMR chemical shift of 0.7 ppm, unequivocally confirming the presence of four-coordinate boron atoms. The sum of the seven dihedral angles (ϕ) for the inner rim of the helicene is 91.2° (Figure 2d). The measured value for the dihedral angle between the mean planes of the terminal rings (A, B) is only 13.8° and the shortest π-π distance between the IQ-moieties is ca. 3.1 Å, indicating substantial intramolecular π-π interactions be-tween nearly parallel orientated IQ moieties. In the packing arrangement, each enantiomer is homo-chirally stacked to form vertical columns (Figure 2f), with adjacent homomers tilted versus each other and rotated by ca. 180° (antiparallel orientation) around the helical axis. Such an alignment results in weak π-π interactions due to only small overlap of the helicene rings with the shortest intermolecular distance of ca. 3.5 Å. The solid-state struc-ture is therefore mostly defined by the CNone H···π interactions between the molecules in a stack and via intermolecular chalcogen-chalcogen interactions between the neighboring stacks of the opposite chirality, assisted by weak CNone H···S hydrogen bonding (H···S of 2.96 Å and CNone H···S bond angle of 163.5°).[39] The corresponding sulfur-sulfur short contacts were measured as 3.22 Å between two inner thiophene sulfur atoms and 3.47 Å for two outer sulfur atoms (Fig-ure 2g). H1-Me4 displays excellent configurational stability. Ac-cording to DFT calculations, enantiomerization occurs via a single transition state associated with ΔG‡en of 39.1 kcalmolNone 1 (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP, CH2Cl2, PCM solvent model) (Figure 4c), in contrast to carbo[n]helicenes consisting exclusively of ortho-fused six-membered benzoid rings. Theoretical studies of the latter compounds revealed that their P-M interconversion follows a multi-step mecha-nism for n�8 via 2n-14 intermediates.[40] The different enantiomerization mechanisms of H1-Me4 when compared to the corresponding carbo[9]helicene can be explained by the presence of as many as five 5-membered thiophene and azaborole rings in its structure. Accordingly, the less favorable geometries of the heteroles entails the smaller overlap of the outer helicene rings, which results in the lower ΔG‡en or even in a different isomerization mechanism when compared to carbohelicenes consisting of the same number of rings. The attempts to experimentally verify the calculated barrier were unsuccessful, as an experiment at 220 °C in tetraglyme resulted in complete decomposition of the compound after only 10 min. Additionally, heating at 170 °C in 1,2-dichlorobenzene led to slow decomposition of the enantiomer without any detectable racemization, yet validating the high inversion barrier. Absorption and Emission Properties In a solution of CH2Cl2, H1-Me4 shows moderate molar absorption coefficients (ɛ) (14.4×103 MNone 1 cmNone 1) for the low-est-energy absorption band at 421 nm, followed by weak and moderate bands at 355 nm and 310 nm and a stronger band at 251 nm (Table S11, Supporting Information, and Fig-ure 5a). Time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations at the CAM[41]-B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP (solvent CH2Cl2, PCM model) level of theory indicate that the lowest-energy absorption band is a superposition of two transitions (oscillator strengths f of 0.39 and 0.03) corresponding primarily to the HOMO to LUMO transition, where the HOMO is delocalized over the whole molecule with the largest coefficients at the DTT moiety, while the LUMO is predominantly confined to the IQ moieties and azaborole rings (Table S17 and Figures S40 and S41, Supporting Information). The corresponding absorption band in toluene is slightly bathochromically shifted to 431 nm and shows a more defined vibronic progression. The compound emits in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum in both solvents (Figure 5b). The fluorescence maxima are posi-tioned at 469 nm and 465 nm in CH2Cl2 and toluene, respectively, in the range desirable for blue emitters for OLEDs, and correspond to Stokes shifts of 2430 and 1700 cmNone 1, respectively. Thus, the compound shows a very weak solvatochromic effect. Φfl values were determined as 0.14 in toluene and 0.17 in CH2Cl2. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest reported values to date for laterally non-extended thiahelicenes. Chiroptical Properties The enantiomers of compound H1-Me4 were resolved by semi-preparative HPLC on a chiral stationary phase to obtain both stereoisomers in purity of >99% ee (Figure S38, Supporting Information). According to TD-DFT calcula-tions at the CAM-B3YP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP (solvent CH2Cl2, PCM model) level of theory, the first and second fractions were ascribed to (P)-and (M)-H1-Me4, respec-tively (Figure S42, Supporting Information). The electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra, recorded in CH2Cl2, show a complex pattern with multiple Cotton effects (Figure 6a). The spectrum of the (P)-enantiomer exhibits moderate positive signals at 392 nm (Δɛ= +36 MNone 1 cmNone 1) and 328 nm (Δɛ= +27 MNone 1 cmNone 1), a small positive signal at 289 nm (Δɛ= +5.4 MNone 1 cmNone 1) and an intense positive CD band at 234 nm (Δɛ=167 MNone 1 cmNone 1). A very weak negative signal can be observed at 438 nm (Δɛ= None 1.5 MNone 1 cmNone 1), followed by neg-ative CD bands at 353 nm (Δɛ= None 4.6 MNone 1 cmNone 1), 302 nm (Δɛ= None 16 MNone 1 cmNone 1), 274 nm (Δɛ= None 16 MNone 1 cmNone 1), and 255 nm (Δɛ= None 15 MNone 1 cmNone 1). The ECD spectrum of (M)-H1-Me4 remains in a mirror-image relationship with that of its enantiomer. The absorption anisotropy factors (gabs) associ-ated with the two lowest-energy CD bands are None 1.9×10None 4 at 438 nm and 3.3×10None 3 at 392 nm, the latter being similar to the jgabs j values for CD bands at 234 nm (3.5×10 None 3) and 328 nm (2.9×10None 3). Likewise, the CPL spectra of both enantiomers of H1-Me4 show an interesting pattern (Fig-ure 6b). The signals are bisignate, albeit very weak. The corresponding jglum j values were determined to be ca. 0.5× 10None 3 and 0.9×10None 3 at around 450 and 500 nm, respectively. Electrochemistry The electrochemical properties of compound H1-Me4 were studied by cyclic (CV) and differential pulse (DPV) voltammetry in acetonitrile (MeCN) in the presence of Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte (Figure 7 and Ta-ble S12, Supporting Information). The measurements were calibrated versus ferrocenium/ ferrocene (Fc+/Fc). The CV displays two irreversible oxidation peaks at 0.79 eV and 1.12 eV, as well as a reversible reduction peak at None 2.11 eV and a quasi-reversible reduction peak at None 2.30 eV. This is in good accordance with the data measured by DPV. The calculated band gap of 2.88 eV is comparable to the optical band gap (2.88 eV in toluene and 2.94 eV in CH2Cl2). Interestingly, despite the presence of three thiophene rings, the redox potentials of H1-Me4 are similar to those of azabora[7]helicenes B [16a] containing a single azaborole ring. On the other hand, the reduction of H1-Me4 is more feasible than reduction of helicenes of type H[42] and diborylated C,[24] implying that it is more electron-deficient than the latter compounds. Conclusion In this article, we report the concise synthesis of an unprecedented thia[9]helicene consisting of two rare thieno-[2,3-c][1,2]azaborole motifs. Its challenging preparation was successfully achieved in only six steps, starting from commercially available thiophene and isoquinoline building blocks, in an overall yield of 13%. The critical step involved formation of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothio-phene moiety to generate highly congested unusual atropi-someric teraryls with nearly parallel oriented isoquinoline moieties. These compounds, as well as nearly all intermedi-ates of the synthesis, were analyzed by X-ray crystallogra-phy. The crystal structure of meso-TA-TIPS2 revealed the formation of four complementary CNone H···N hydrogen bonds between two neighboring molecules. According to our experimental and theoretical studies these atropisomers feature high configurational stability. The calculated ΔG‡diast value of 36.1 kcalmolNone 1 (inversion of the enantiomer to the meso-form), being comparable to that of BINOL, together with two coordination sites makes these compounds attrac-tive for application as ligands in catalysis. The azaborole ring formation to fix the helical geometry was executed via a novel silicon-boron exchange reaction between the TIPS-substituted teraryls and BBr3 or BCl3. This establishes a new synthetic method for the preparation of azaboroles. Cyclization was followed by the ligand exchange at the boron centers to afford the target compound in satisfactory yields of up to 45% over two steps. The packing arrangement of this unique helicene is defined by intermolecular CNone H···π and chalcogen-chalcogen interac-tions. Its emission maximum is positioned at 465–469 nm, which falls within the optimal range for blue emitters for OLEDs, while its fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 is the highest reported to date for non-extended thiahelicenes. Even though silicon-boron exchange reactions are common in the literature, this is the first example where more stable TIPS groups have been utilized in these trans-formations, which amplifies chemical space by providing an opportunity for performing orthogonal reactions.

        "Synthesis of a Blue-Emissive Azaborathia[9]helicene by Silicon-Boron Exchange from Unusual Atropisomeric Teraryls",
        "Daniel Volland, Jan Niedens, Patrick T. Geppert, Martijn J. Wildervanck, Felix Full, and Agnieszka Nowak-Król*Abstract: We report the concise synthesis and chir-(optical) properties of an azaborathia[9]helicene consist-ing of two thienoazaborole motifs. The key intermedi-ate, a highly congested teraryl with nearly parallel isoquinoline moieties, was generated as a mixture of atropisomers upon fusion of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothiophene moiety. These diastereomers were characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis revealing intriguing interactions in the solid state. Subsequent insertion of boron into the aromatic scaffold via silicon-boron exchange involving triisopropylsilyl groups fixed the helical geometry, thereby establishing a novel method for the preparation of azaboroles. The ligand exchange at boron in the final step afforded the blue emitter displaying a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 and excellent configurational stability. Detailed structural and theoretical investigation of unusual atropisomers and the helicene provide insights into their isomerization processes.",
        "Helicenes, defined by IUPAC as ortho-fused polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds in which all rings (minimum five) are angularly arranged,[1] adopt an aesthetic non-planar screw-shaped geometry. The scientific interest in such systems primarily manifests from their unique elec-tronic properties emerging from the combination of their inherent helical chirality and the extended aromatic scaffold.[2] This results in appreciable chiral responses, e.g. high values of optical rotation (OR) and the emergence of circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).[3] Hence, their areas of use span from ligands in asymmetric catalysis[4] and biological systems (DNA-binding),[5] over nanocages[6] to semiconductors[7] and CPL-materials, e.g. light-emitting diodes.[8] Furthermore, since the discovery of chiral-induced spin selectivity,[9] chiral molecules are of interest for the potential embedment in spintronic devices.[10]This versatile range of applications is owed to the tunability of helicenes’ properties, which can be adjusted by a series of architectural acts, such as heteroatom-doping within the helical framework,[11] e.g. Lewis acidic boron with an empty pz-orbital can be introduced into the aromatic scaffold at strategic positions[12] and stabilized by an adjacent[*] D.

        "nitrogen atom.[13] Replacing CNone C bonds with a BNone N pair tremendously alters the electronic behavior of the system, hence its optical properties, while also affecting the molec-ular geometry.[14] This was exemplified by a hexahelicene bearing one BNone N-motif (A, Figure 1) that displayed im-proved absorptivity, fluorescence efficiency and racemiza-tion half-life compared to its parent carbo[6]helicene.[15] Likewise, the implementation of azaborole rings exhibits a positive impact on the optical properties of helicenes. We demonstrated this for azabora[7]helicenes B, whose Φfl along with absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors could be further enhanced by lateral extension.[16] The effect of a B !N dative bond can be amplified by the introduction of additional azaborole rings, as observed for single and double [6]-or [5]helicenes D–F bearing two boron centers, though all these compounds feature low configurational stability.[16a,17] As opposed to borahelicenes, the Φfl values of thiophene-containing congeners are usually extremely low. Effective strategies to improve their emissive properties is lateral extension to produce push-pull systems,[18] and oxidation of thiophene to the corresponding sulfone.[19]Thiophene is widely used in organic semiconductors, such as conductive polymers poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).[20] The beneficial features of embedding thiophene are twofold. Firstly, its predictable reactivity difference at the 2-and 3-positions opens up the possibility for regioselective synthetic functionalizations. Secondly, the optoelectronic properties of thiahelicenes can be further altered via inter-and intra-molecular chalcogen-chalcogen interactions involving sulfur atoms,[21] which facilitate favorable packing arrangements in the solid state, essential for the charge carrier transport.",
        "Since the seminal work by Wynberg, a wealth of thiahelicenes have been reported, including those composed of alternating benzene and thiophene rings (e.g. H),[22] or their combination with cyclopentadiene and other heteroles, such as phosphole and pyrrole (compounds I).[23] Only recently, Licandro and Wagner reported a similar thiaheli-cene system where two benzene rings were replaced with 1,2-oxaborinine heterocycles (helicene C).[24] This variety of thiahelicenes concludes with an extraordinary subclass of molecules assembled from angularly fused thiophene rings (e.g. G).[25]A positive effect of azaborole on the emission features of π-conjugated scaffolds and an abundance of thiophene-based semiconductors with highly aligned molecular arrays in the solid state prompted us to design azaborathia-[9]helicene H1-R4, the first helicene consisting of azaborole and thiophene. The ring combination present in this system, where a B !N bond and a sulfur atom are on the same edge of the molecule, is scarce in the literature, presumably due to synthetic challenges and a higher liability of boron-nitrogen bonding when compared to thieno[3,2-c]-[1,2]azaborole derivatives with an inverted thiophene ring. To our knowledge, there are only two small molecules with a thieno[2,3-c][1,2]azaborole structural motif.[26] We also report an entirely new method for the preparation of azaboroles, based on silicon-boron exchange that we have developed to synthesize this unique chiral system as well as its unusual highly congested atropisomeric teraryl precur-sors.",
        "SynthesisThe modular approach we proposed for the construction of azaborole-containing helicenes B and E[16a] is built on the basis of the coupling between small building blocks to afford either bi-or oligoaryls, followed by a subsequent borylation reaction, which fixes the helical conformation. Due to the straightforward execution, this approach appeared to be suitable to synthesize helicene H1. The key intermediate in this route is diborylated dithienothiophene (DTT) DTT-(Bpin)2. This compound is required for the subsequent cross-coupling with commercially available IQ-Cl to provide teraryl TA. (Scheme S2, Supporting Information). However, attempts at its synthesis from brominated congener DTT-Br2 [27] via Miyaura borylation with B2pin2 using either Pd2(dba)3/XPhos or Pd(dppf)Cl2 in the presence of KOAc were unsuccessful. Retrosynthetic analysis allowed us to design an alternative route in which the molecule was disconnected so as to form the CNone C bond between the two thiophene rings at a later stage of the synthetic sequence (Scheme 1). This strategy required the installation of both isoquinoline (IQ) moieties prior to the fusion of the central thiophene ring of the DTT moiety. The synthesis started with the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling between IQ-Cl and Th-Bpin to obtain biaryl BA in a very good yield of 92%. The introduction of a triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group to block the reactive α-position of the thiophene ring adjacent to the IQ residue provided BA-TIPS in a 63% yield. Its subsequent coupling with bis(phenylsulfonyl)sulfide[27] gave rise to oligoarylic intermediate OA-TIPS2 in a yield of 80%. In the next step, we tested the conditions for the ring-closing reaction. However, neither photoreaction nor oxidative coupling with FeCl3, FeClO4, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ), or CuOAc2 allowed for the success-ful synthesis of the target compound. We then carried out a Pd-catalyzed dual CNone H activation reaction. The original conditions, as reported by Che et al.,[28] using Pd(OAc)2, AgOAc, Na2CO3 and pivalic acid as the solvent, provided the desired compound, although only in trace amounts. To improve the reaction efficiency and ensure its reproducibil-ity, we screened the conditions varying catalyst salts, loadings, oxidant, solvent mixtures and reaction times (Table S1, Supporting Information). During these studies we isolated two fractions. While both ESI mass spectra revealed peaks at m/z�763.31, the corresponding 1H NMR spectra differed significantly (see structural investigation below) indicating the formation of isomers. In fact, the steric clash generated by two TIPS groups and two IQ moieties in close proximity produced atropisomers, i.e., a pair of enantiomers and a meso-compound. Due to the significant difference in their polarity, the diastereomers could be readily separated via standard column or flash chromatography. Finally, the optimal conditions were identified for the reaction of OA-ChemieResearch ArticlesAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, 62, e202304291 (2 of 10) © 2023 The Authors. Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley-VCH GmbHTIPS2 with Pd(TFA)2, Ag2CO3 and K2CO3 in the presence of pivalic acid in toluene, which allowed for reproducible combined yields of around 60% of the isomeric products. Given the enormous steric congestion produced by the four bulky substituents around the two CNone C single bonds, this result was highly satisfactory. Initially, we also used trimeth-ylsilyl-protected precursors in this synthetic sequence (for details, see Supporting Information). However, the TMS groups proved too labile preventing chemoselective fusion of the two thiophene rings.",
        "As revealed by the single crystal X-ray analysis (see below), the first fraction corresponded to the racemate, while the second to the meso-compound. This assignment is in line with their relative polarity. The nitrogen atoms in the enantiomers point in the opposite directions resulting in a low dipole moment (2.7 D), as indicated by DFT calcula-tions (B3LYP[29]-D3(BJ)[30]/def2-SVP[31]), due to the cancel-lation of the two opposite effects of each IQ moiety. In contrast, the nitrogen atoms in the meso-compound are located on the same face of the DTT plane. This spatial arrangement gives rise to a higher dipole moment (5.2 D) than that of the enantiomers, consequently facilitating the separation of rac-TA-TIPS2 from the meso-form. On the other hand, despite testing different chiral columns and solvent mixtures we were not able to resolve the (Ra,Ra)-from the (Sa,Sa)-enantiomers by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Table S13, Supporting Informa-tion). In the next step, the TIPS groups were cleaved with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to afford TA (depro-tection route) in a yield of 83%. This reaction was followed by electrophilic borylation of the thiophene α-position with boron tribromide in the presence of the Hünig’s base under modified Murakami’s conditions.[16a,32] The intermediate bromide-substituted azaborole was not isolated due to its low solubility but reacted directly with trimethylaluminum to afford target H1-Me4 in a yield below 5% over two steps. The low efficiency of this reaction is in stark contrast to the analogous generation of helicenes via borylation of carbocy-clic rings. This unsatisfactory result and a cumbersome purification of TA due to the residual TBA salts prompted us to reevaluate our synthetic protocol. Accordingly, we subjected TA-TIPS2 directly to a reaction (direct method) with BBr3 in the absence of the Hünig’s base. Noteworthy, such silicon-boron exchange reactions are unprecedented in the chemistry of azaboroles. After 6 h the volatiles were removed and the bromide complex was submitted to the next reaction without any further purification. The synthesis was accomplished via the ligand exchange at the boron atoms to afford H1-Me4 in a yield of 42%. We wondered whether the orientation of the IQ moieties in TA-TIPS2 affects the tendency of the compound to form the helicene. The alignment of the IQs in the enantiomers mirrors that in the target compound and hence, the closure of the azaborole rings could be, in principle, more feasible. To verify this hypothesis, we reacted the isomeric fractions independently with BBr3 affording the target helicene in similar and reproducible yields. This indicates the comparable reactiv-ities of all stereoisomers towards BBr3 under our conditions. Additionally, we tested the use of boron trichloride in this transformation. To our delight, the borylation, followed by the analogous ligand exchange protocol, provided H1-Me4 in a satisfactory yield of 45%. Even though silicon-boron exchange reactions are widely reported in the literature for the preparation of a plethora of oligomers, polymers and boron containing heterocycles,[33] all these methods utilize TMS groups. To our knowledge, this is the first case of silicon-boron exchange involving the more robust and bulky TIPS groups in combination with BBr3 or BCl3.",
        "Structural InvestigationsThe target compound and nearly all intermediates of the synthesis, in addition to the TMS derivatives, were charac-terized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 2 and Supporting Information).[34]The ring-closing reaction produced isomers TA-TIPS2 with a fixed mutual orientation of both IQ substituents, as revealed by their solid-state structures. Single crystals of both fractions were grown from solutions of chloroform byvapor diffusion with n-hexane. The first fraction, identified as a racemate, crystallized in the P21/n space group. The unit cell contains two pairs of the (Ra,Ra)-and (Sa,Sa)-isomers, that are distinguished by the nitrogen atoms of the IQ-moieties facing away from each other (Figure 2a). This leads to the overlap of only pyridine rings with a distance of 3.38– 3.39 Å. meso-TA-TIPS2 crystallized in the P-1 space group. As opposed to the enantiomers, the IQ residues of the meso-compound are cofacially stacked with the nitrogen atoms facing the same direction (Figure 2b). This orientation results in the full overlap of both IQ moieties. The distance determined between these substituents was 3.30–3.34 Å. In all diastereomers, the IQ residues are essentially parallel to each other. Accordingly, the dihedral angles between the mean planes of the pyridine rings were measured to be 4.8° and 2.4° for the racemate and the meso-compound, respec-tively. Moreover, the angles between the DTT and IQ mean planes are 77.6° and 75.9° for meso-TA-TIPS2 and 75.4° for the enantiomers, pointing out that the IQ substituents are strongly tilted versus the DTT central unit. The bulky groups effectively prevent π–π interactions between the DTT moieties. Interestingly, four complementary CNone H···N hydrogen bonds were visible between two neighboring molecules of meso-TA-TIPS2 (Figure 2e), while these inter-actions were absent in the packing arrangement of rac-TA-TIPS2.",
        "The hindered rotation of the IQ moieties in isomeric TA-TIPS2 was also confirmed by sharp, well-resolved 1H NMR spectra in CD2Cl2 at 298 K (Figure 3a,b). Unequal alignment of the IQ moieties results in clear differences in the chemical shifts of the corresponding signals, particularly in the aromatic region.",
        "All signals were unequivocally assigned based on the 2D NMR spectra (Figures S24–S27, Supporting Information). The most significant difference was observed for proton H1 of the pyridine ring. This proton was ascribed to a doublet at δ=7.21 ppm with a coupling constant J=5.6 Hz in the spectrum of the racemate, while the corresponding signal for the meso-compound (J=5.7 Hz) was downfield-shifted to δ=8.04 ppm. On the other hand, a doublet of doublet of doublets at δ=6.76 ppm in the spectrum of meso-TA-TIPS2 was assigned to H5, while it was downfield-shifted (δ= 7.32 ppm) for rac-TA-TIPS2.",
        "The high steric hindrance endowed the compounds with significant configurational stability, even when compared to BINOL (ΔG‡en=37.7 kcalmoNone 1).[35] DFT calculations (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP) indicated that the meso-form (Ra,Sa) is 6.7 kcalmol None 1 higher in energy than the enantiom-ers (Figures 4b and S44a, Supporting Information). This could be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the two nitrogen atoms of both IQ moieties being in close proximity in the meso-compound. Moreover, conversion of the thermodynamically preferred enantiomer into the meso-form would require overcoming a barrier of 36.1 kcalmolNone 1, while the reverse process (the meso-to-enantiomer inver-sion) is associated with the barrier of 29.4 kcalmolNone 1 (Fig-ure 4b). Noteworthy, the process is extremely complex due to high conformational freedom, involving rotation of the IQ residues around the CNone C bonds and the TIPS groups (see Supporting Information). To determine the conversion of the meso-compound into the enantiomers, the sample of energetically less preferred meso-TA-TIPS2 was heated at 120 °C and the decreasing integration of the meso-form was monitored by HPLC. Due to the significant difference in their thermodynamic stabilities, the reverse reaction was neglected and the diastereomerization process was approxi-mated with first-order kinetics[36] (see Supporting Informa-tion). The estimated ΔG‡diast value of 30.8 kcalmolNone 1 is in fair agreement with our theoretical studies.",
        "Cleavage of the silyl groups with TBAF in either isomer led to TA, which showed significantly broadened signals in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum in CD2Cl2 at 298 K due to the now freely but slowly rotating IQ residues. The dynamic behavior of this compound was studied by variable-temperature (VT)-1H NMR spectroscopy in CD2Cl2 (Figure 3c). The lowering of the temperature resulted in a gradual sharpening of the signals with the coalescence temperature of ca. 280 K. The measurements at temper-atures of 253 K and lower yielded resolved and sharp proton signals, indicating hindered rotation of the IQ moieties of TA on the NMR time scale. Therefore, analogously to the TIPS-protected compounds, atropisomers can be distin-guished under these conditions. This explains the second set of proton signals in the 1H NMR spectrum that developed stepwise between 283 K and 233 K. The two species are present in a ratio of �3.6 : 1 (22% of the meso-compound). According to DFT calculations (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP) the (Ra,Ra)-and (Sa,Sa)-TA are 0.7 kcalmol None 1 energetically more preferable than the corresponding meso-compound (Figure 4a). A calculation for a chemical equilibrium between two species, the enantiomer and the meso-form, suggests that the lower energy conformation would be adapted by 23% of the overall population of molecules in solution at room temperature. This is in excellent agreement with the results of VT NMR spectroscopy. However, the interconversion of the more stable species into another diastereomer requires relatively low energy so that the process is rapid at room temperature. The experimental ΔG‡diast value for the interconversion barrier, determined by dynamic NMR spectroscopy, is ca. 15 kcalmolNone 1 (Table S14, Supporting Information). This result is consistent with our DFT calculations. In principle, rotation of IQ residues in TA can proceed in either direction due to the rotational freedom around the CNone C bonds. This gives rise to three distinct interconversion pathways via transition states with a) both nitrogen atoms pointing inward, b) one nitrogen pointing inward and one pointing outward and c) both nitrogen atoms pointing outward as a rate-determining step (RDS) (Figure 4a and Figure S43, Supporting Information). The most feasible interconversion pathway is the one in which the IQ pyridine rings are tilted toward each other (pathway a). The RDS is preceded by conformational changes of the enantiomeric species, where (Sa,Sa)-TA-C1 is lower in energy by 2.5 kcalmolNone 1 than (Sa,Sa)-TA-C2 with the IQ residues more strongly bent out of the DTT mean plane. The degree of distortion in both molecules can be illustrated by the torsion angle ∡(CIQ1-CTh1-CTh2-CIQ2) (ψ) (cf. Figure 2c) that is measured as 17.8° and 30.5° for (Sa,Sa)-TA-C1 and -C2 (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP, gas phase), respectively. Interestingly, the latter conformation is even higher in energy than the meso-form.",
        "The crystals of TA, obtained by recrystallization from CH2Cl2 and pentane (P-1 space group), consisted exclusively of (Ra,Ra)-and (Sa,Sa)-enantiomers (Figure 2c). With angle ψ of 34.3°, they resemble conformation (Sa,Sa)-TA-C2 rather than the global minima obtained by DFT calculations. This is not an unusual situation for the solid state structures, as shown by a systematic analysis of an extensive number of single crystals by Pascal[37] and revealed in studies of warped molecules.[38] The molecule is significantly more distorted than the TIPS derivative as torsion angle ψ in the enantiomer of the latter compound (solid-state structure) was only 3.8° (Figure 2a), that is, by ca. 30° lower than in TA. A larger conformational space in TA is reflected by the smaller dihedral angles (58.0°) between the DTT and IQ mean planes, while the two IQ moieties remain nearly parallel (a dihedral angle of 7.8°). The absence of the TIPS groups enabled intermolecular π-π interactions. The distance between IQ moieties of the neighboring TA molecules in a homochiral stack is ca. 3.5 Å. This stack is interacting withadjacent stacks of the other enantiomer via CNone H···π hydro-gen bonds.",
        "The crystals of rac-H1-Me4 were grown via diffusion of n-hexane into a solution of chloroform. The compound crystallized in the P-1 space group. The BNone N bond lengths in the two azaborole rings were measured as 1.631(4) and 1.638(6) Å implying strong Lewis pair interactions, which is in agreement with a 11B NMR chemical shift of 0.7 ppm, unequivocally confirming the presence of four-coordinate boron atoms. The sum of the seven dihedral angles (ϕ) for the inner rim of the helicene is 91.2° (Figure 2d). The measured value for the dihedral angle between the mean planes of the terminal rings (A, B) is only 13.8° and the shortest π-π distance between the IQ-moieties is ca. 3.1 Å, indicating substantial intramolecular π-π interactions be-tween nearly parallel orientated IQ moieties.",
        "In the packing arrangement, each enantiomer is homo-chirally stacked to form vertical columns (Figure 2f), with adjacent homomers tilted versus each other and rotated by ca. 180° (antiparallel orientation) around the helical axis. Such an alignment results in weak π-π interactions due to only small overlap of the helicene rings with the shortest intermolecular distance of ca. 3.5 Å. The solid-state struc-ture is therefore mostly defined by the CNone H···π interactions between the molecules in a stack and via intermolecular chalcogen-chalcogen interactions between the neighboring stacks of the opposite chirality, assisted by weak CNone H···S hydrogen bonding (H···S of 2.96 Å and CNone H···S bond angle of 163.5°).[39] The corresponding sulfur-sulfur short contacts were measured as 3.22 Å between two inner thiophene sulfur atoms and 3.47 Å for two outer sulfur atoms (Fig-ure 2g).",
        "H1-Me4 displays excellent configurational stability. Ac-cording to DFT calculations, enantiomerization occurs via a single transition state associated with ΔG‡en of 39.1 kcalmolNone 1 (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP, CH2Cl2, PCM solvent model) (Figure 4c), in contrast to carbo[n]helicenes consisting exclusively of ortho-fused six-membered benzoid rings. Theoretical studies of the latter compounds revealed that their P-M interconversion follows a multi-step mecha-nism for n�8 via 2n-14 intermediates.[40] The different enantiomerization mechanisms of H1-Me4 when compared to the corresponding carbo[9]helicene can be explained by the presence of as many as five 5-membered thiophene and azaborole rings in its structure. Accordingly, the less favorable geometries of the heteroles entails the smaller overlap of the outer helicene rings, which results in the lower ΔG‡en or even in a different isomerization mechanism when compared to carbohelicenes consisting of the same number of rings. The attempts to experimentally verify the calculated barrier were unsuccessful, as an experiment at 220 °C in tetraglyme resulted in complete decomposition of the compound after only 10 min. Additionally, heating at 170 °C in 1,2-dichlorobenzene led to slow decomposition of the enantiomer without any detectable racemization, yet validating the high inversion barrier.",
        "In a solution of CH2Cl2, H1-Me4 shows moderate molar absorption coefficients (ɛ) (14.4×103 MNone 1 cmNone 1) for the low-est-energy absorption band at 421 nm, followed by weak and moderate bands at 355 nm and 310 nm and a stronger band at 251 nm (Table S11, Supporting Information, and Fig-ure 5a). Time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations at the CAM[41]-B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP (solvent CH2Cl2, PCM model) level of theory indicate that the lowest-energy absorption band is a superposition of two transitions (oscillator strengths f of 0.39 and 0.03) corresponding primarily to the HOMO to LUMO transition, where the HOMO is delocalized over the whole molecule with the largest coefficients at the DTT moiety, while the LUMO is predominantly confined to the IQ moieties and azaborole rings (Table S17 and Figures S40 and S41, Supporting Information). The corresponding absorption band in toluene is slightly bathochromically shifted to 431 nm and shows a more defined vibronic progression. The compound emits in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum in both solvents (Figure 5b). The fluorescence maxima are posi-tioned at 469 nm and 465 nm in CH2Cl2 and toluene, respectively, in the range desirable for blue emitters for OLEDs, and correspond to Stokes shifts of 2430 and 1700 cmNone 1, respectively. Thus, the compound shows a very weak solvatochromic effect. Φfl values were determined as 0.14 in toluene and 0.17 in CH2Cl2. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest reported values to date for laterally non-extended thiahelicenes. Chiroptical PropertiesThe enantiomers of compound H1-Me4 were resolved by semi-preparative HPLC on a chiral stationary phase to obtain both stereoisomers in purity of >99% ee (Figure S38, Supporting Information). According to TD-DFT calcula-tions at the CAM-B3YP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP (solvent CH2Cl2, PCM model) level of theory, the first and second fractions were ascribed to (P)-and (M)-H1-Me4, respec-tively (Figure S42, Supporting Information). The electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra, recorded in CH2Cl2, show a complex pattern with multiple Cotton effects (Figure 6a). The spectrum of the (P)-enantiomer exhibits moderate positive signals at 392 nm (Δɛ= +36 MNone 1 cmNone 1) and 328 nm (Δɛ= +27 MNone 1 cmNone 1), a small positive signal at 289 nm (Δɛ= +5.4 MNone 1 cmNone 1) and an intense positive CD band at 234 nm (Δɛ=167 MNone 1 cmNone 1). A very weak negative signal can be observed at 438 nm (Δɛ= None 1.5 MNone 1 cmNone 1), followed by neg-ative CD bands at 353 nm (Δɛ= None 4.6 MNone 1 cmNone 1), 302 nm (Δɛ= None 16 MNone 1 cmNone 1), 274 nm (Δɛ= None 16 MNone 1 cmNone 1), and 255 nm (Δɛ= None 15 MNone 1 cmNone 1). The ECD spectrum of (M)-H1-Me4 remains in a mirror-image relationship with that of its enantiomer. The absorption anisotropy factors (gabs) associ-ated with the two lowest-energy CD bands are None 1.9×10None 4 at 438 nm and 3.3×10None 3 at 392 nm, the latter being similar to the jgabs j values for CD bands at 234 nm (3.5×10 None 3) and 328 nm (2.9×10None 3). Likewise, the CPL spectra of both enantiomers of H1-Me4 show an interesting pattern (Fig-ure 6b). The signals are bisignate, albeit very weak. The corresponding jglum j values were determined to be ca. 0.5× 10None 3 and 0.9×10None 3 at around 450 and 500 nm, respectively.",
        "ElectrochemistryThe electrochemical properties of compound H1-Me4 were studied by cyclic (CV) and differential pulse (DPV) voltammetry in acetonitrile (MeCN) in the presence of Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte (Figure 7 and Ta-ble S12, Supporting Information).",
        "The measurements were calibrated versus ferrocenium/ ferrocene (Fc+/Fc). The CV displays two irreversible oxidation peaks at 0.79 eV and 1.12 eV, as well as a reversible reduction peak at None 2.11 eV and a quasi-reversible reduction peak at None 2.30 eV. This is in good accordance with the data measured by DPV. The calculated band gap of 2.88 eV is comparable to the optical band gap (2.88 eV in toluene and 2.94 eV in CH2Cl2). Interestingly, despite the presence of three thiophene rings, the redox potentials of H1-Me4 are similar to those of azabora[7]helicenes B [16a] containing a single azaborole ring. On the other hand, the reduction of H1-Me4 is more feasible than reduction of helicenes of type H[42] and diborylated C,[24] implying that it is more electron-deficient than the latter compounds.",
        "In this article, we report the concise synthesis of an unprecedented thia[9]helicene consisting of two rare thieno-[2,3-c][1,2]azaborole motifs. Its challenging preparation was successfully achieved in only six steps, starting from commercially available thiophene and isoquinoline building blocks, in an overall yield of 13%. The critical step involved formation of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothio-phene moiety to generate highly congested unusual atropi-someric teraryls with nearly parallel oriented isoquinoline moieties. These compounds, as well as nearly all intermedi-ates of the synthesis, were analyzed by X-ray crystallogra-phy. The crystal structure of meso-TA-TIPS2 revealed the formation of four complementary CNone H···N hydrogen bonds between two neighboring molecules. According to our experimental and theoretical studies these atropisomers feature high configurational stability. The calculated ΔG‡diast value of 36.1 kcalmolNone 1 (inversion of the enantiomer to the meso-form), being comparable to that of BINOL, together with two coordination sites makes these compounds attrac-tive for application as ligands in catalysis.",
        "The azaborole ring formation to fix the helical geometry was executed via a novel silicon-boron exchange reaction between the TIPS-substituted teraryls and BBr3 or BCl3. This establishes a new synthetic method for the preparation of azaboroles. Cyclization was followed by the ligand exchange at the boron centers to afford the target compound in satisfactory yields of up to 45% over two steps. The packing arrangement of this unique helicene is defined by intermolecular CNone H···π and chalcogen-chalcogen interac-tions. Its emission maximum is positioned at 465–469 nm, which falls within the optimal range for blue emitters for OLEDs, while its fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 is the highest reported to date for non-extended thiahelicenes.",
        "Even though silicon-boron exchange reactions are common in the literature, this is the first example where more stable TIPS groups have been utilized in these trans-formations, which amplifies chemical space by providing an opportunity for performing orthogonal reactions.",
