[Reaction Miner: An Integrated System for Chemical Reaction Extraction from Textual Data](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.36/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment and Installation
To get started, simply run
```
pip install git+https://github.com/alexey-krasnov/ReactionMiner
```

Or install the necessary packages step-by-step:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexey-krasnov/ReactionMiner
cd ReactionMiner
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
pip install -e . 
```

For using the PDF-to-Text module in Reaction Miner, ensure Maven and Java 1.8 are installed. Then, execute:
```
cd pdf2text/SymbolScraper
git submodule update --init
make
```

## üìñ How to Use Reaction Miner
Given a PDF file, please refer to [example.py](./example.py) to run our entire system. It can be broken down into the following three steps:

### Step 1: PDF-to-Text Conversion
This step transforms a PDF file into text, saving a json file:

```python
from pdf2text.generalParser import parseFile
pdf_path = "copper_acetate.pdf" # PDF file given by the user
result = parseFile(pdf_path)
full_text = result['fullText'] # Text without paragraph information
paragraphs = result['contents']  # Text with paragraph boundaries
```

The converted text is saved in `pdf2text/results`.

### Step 2: Text Segmentation
Identifies paragraphs about chemical reactions and segments them:

```python
from segmentation.segmentor import TopicSegmentor
segmentor = TopicSegmentor()
seg_texts = segmentor.segment(paragraphs)
```

### Step 3: Reaction Extraction
Extracts structured chemical reactions from each segment:

```python
from extraction.extractor import ReactionExtractor
extractor = ReactionExtractor('7b')
reactions = extractor.extract(seg_texts)
```

## ü§ñ Model Training
We fine-tune Llama-2-7B with LoRA, a technique for efficient fine-tuning, on our collected training set for our reaction extractor.
Explore the training details in [extraction/training](extraction/training).
