These transformations include the domino-style formation of C–C/C– N bonds through a base-mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, N-cyclization, and elimin-ation. The presented synthetic strategy has several advantages: it is simple, uses readily available starting materials and an environmentally friendly solvent, has a highly chemoselective route, and allows the purification of products via washing with EtOH (96%), a technique called GAP (Group-Assisted-Purification) chemistry. Introduction Maleimides, one of the five members of the family of N-heterocyclic pharmacophores with two carbonyl groups adja-cent to the nitrogen atom, are useful building blocks for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. Maleimides also describes a class of derivatives of the parent maleimide where the NH group is replaced with alkyl or aryl groups such as a methyl or phenyl, respectively. The substitu-ent can also be a small molecule (for example, biotin, a fluo-rescent dye, an oligosaccharide, or a nucleic acid).1 These com-pounds exhibit a variety of interesting pharmaceutical pro-perties, including antiepileptic (ethosuximide), anxiolytic and antidepressant (tandospirone), and antipsychotic (perospir-one) properties.2,3 Also, certain anti-inflammatory compounds contain these targeted heterocycles.4 In addition, many N-substituted maleimides possess activities such as antitu-mor,5 antiviral,6 antimicrobial,7 anti-fungal,8 and insecticidal (larvicidal) activities. Maleimides are also important building blocks for the synthesis of high-performance polymers.9 The most common representatives of this class of chemicals are α-aminomaleimides, which have become increasingly popular in organic synthesis. A notable characteristic of α-aminomaleimides is their highly polarized ethylene system in which electron-donating (amino group) and electron-with-drawing (two carbonyl groups) substituents are found on either end. Thus, reactions of α-aminomaleimides with diverse bis-electrophiles have been extensively studied as methods for constructing nitrogen-containing heterocycles or fused hetero-cycles. Among them, the syntheses of pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridines,10 trifluoromethylated pyrazol-4-yl-pyrrole-2,5-diones,11 pyrrolo[3,4-d]tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives,12 and pyrrolo[3,4-b]quino-lones13 are interesting examples. A special property of malei-mides is their susceptibility to additions across the double bond via Michael additions11,14 or Diels–Alder reactions.15 On the other hand, coumarin is considered a promising scaffold in medicinal and biological chemistry, because it is present as a part of the structure of the nucleus in many med-icinally active organic substances.16 Therefore, one of the most popular areas in synthetic organic chemistry is the develop-ment of effective methods for preparing molecules based on coumarin.17–19 The literature demonstrates that chromenopyridines and hetero-fused chromenopyridines are effective bioactive cores in diverse synthetic and natural compounds. Some representative examples of the biological and photo-physical properties of chromenopyridines and hetero-fused chromenopyridines are shown in Fig. 1. In a review, Núñez-Vergara and his colleagues have introduced chromenopyri-dines as privileged skeletons in medicinal and biological chemistry. They have fully described the processes involved in synthesizing these skeletons and their biological properties.20 So far, many attempts have been made to synthesize hetero-fused chromenopyridines. For example, Magedov et al. have reported the synthesis of 2,3-dihydrochromeno[4,3-d]pyrazolo [3,4-b]pyridin-1,6-diones with antibacterial properties.21 Similarly, Choudhury et al. have reported a three-component †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Experimental and com-putational details; single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis; 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

View Article OnlineView reaction for the synthesis of dihydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrazolo [4,3-e]pyridin-6(7H)-ones using 4-hydroxycoumarin as the key starting material and using iodine as the catalyst.22 Recently, we also reported the synthesis of dihydro-6H-chromeno[4,3-d] pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-6-ones from the reaction of 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarins and 3-amino pyrazoles under mild con-ditions with acceptable efficiency.23 The possibility of a wide range of biological and physical properties makes chromeno-pyridines interesting synthetic targets. As a result, the development of straightforward and flexible synthetic methods toward functionalized chromenopyridines has attracted much attention from organic chemists. Perhaps for this reason, it is necessary to develop new methods to increase the structural complexity while reducing the number of synthetic steps to facilitate the construction of new chromenopyridines. However, there are no reports on the synthesis of tetra-cyclic dihydrochromeno[4,3-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine deriva-tives via reactions of α-aminomaleimides with 4-chloro-3-sub-stituted coumarins. Herein, we envisioned that the chemical entity tetracyclic dihydrochromeno[4,3-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyri-dines, with a hybrid structure involving chromone, pyridine, and maleimide motifs, may possess significant biological features. Results and discussion Recently, 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins have been attract-ing the attention of organic chemists as the most reactive elec-trophiles and the most readily available starting materials for the synthesis of heterocyclic systems based on coumarins.24 Our group has shown great interest in investigating multicom-ponent reactions using this targeted heterocycle. Using it, we produced new complex molecular scaffolds containing the coumarin skeleton.25 Here, we turn our attention to the devel-opment of a two-component reaction using 4-chloro-3-formyl (3-vinyl)coumarins with α-aminomaleimides to access novel complex molecular scaffolds containing coumarin with poten-tial bioactivity. In the beginning, α-aminomaleimide was pre-pared based on a known method.12 Then, with our previous knowledge, we focused on the preparation of 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarins 2 and 4-chloro-3-formyl coumarin 2′.23 α-Aminomaleimide 1 (1.0 equiv.) and 4-chloro-3-vinyl cou-marin 2 or 2′ (1.0 equiv.) in the presence of 50 mol% triethyl-amine and ethanol as the solvent were stirred at 80 °C in an oil bath for more than 12 h. As a result, 3 or 3′ was formed as a red solid (41–92% yield) and filtered (Scheme 1). After the confirmation of the structure of 3a, we tried to find a suitable base and solvent for the model reaction. The results are summarized in Table 1. The reaction was studied in the presence of 10, 20, and 40 mol% of triethylamine as the base in ethanol and the yields obtained were 25, 40, and 60%, respectively (entries 1–3, Table 1). After changing the ratio of triethylamine to 50 mol%, the yield of the pure product was increased to 88% in ethanol. In the next step, the influence of different bases on the reaction outcome was investigated. The yield of the reaction in the pres-ence of DBU was 30%, which indicated no good signs of 3a forming. Also, when piperidine with relatively more nucleophilicity was used for this process, product 3a was not formed, probably because of the nucleophilic replacement of piperidine with the chlorine atom of substrate 2a (Table 1, entry 7). The yield of the reaction in the presence of K2CO3 and CS2CO3 as a base was 40 and 50%, respectively. The effect of different solvents (EtOH, MeOH, DCM, and MeCN) on the progress of the reac-tion was investigated. As shown in Table 1, carrying out the reaction in EtOH was found to be the best choice as it resulted in a better yield (88%). Based on this data, the optimized reac-tion conditions were as follows: using 50 mmol% of Et3N in ethanol at 80 °C in an oil bath. The use of a protic solvent (EtOH and MeOH) seems essential for the reaction to proceed and may be related to the dipole moment as well as the hydro-gen bonding ability of protic solvents. With the optimal reac-tion conditions in hand, we began to investigate the generality and substrate scope of this process. We probed the scope of the annulation with different arylamines. It is noteworthy that the electronic nature of the substituent on the aromatic rings of α-aminomaleimides and 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarins affected the time of the reaction and the yields of products 3a–3h. It was clear that the reaction yield with α-aminomaleimides con-taining electron-donating groups on the aromatic rings such as Me and OMe substituents was better compared to electron-withdrawing groups such as Cl. It is noteworthy that the reac-tion of N-methyl-α-arylaminomaleimide 1a and NO2-substi-tuted 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarin 2e did not proceed well and several overlapping spots were observed. This result may be related to the strong electron-withdrawing property of the nitro group, which reduces the electron density through induction and resonance effects. In addition, the nitro substituent can stabilize the negative charges formed at different stages of this process and prevent the reaction from progressing. Notably, attempts to synthesize the nitro-substituted N-methyl-α-aminomalemide were not successful. In addition, we replaced other alkylamines with N-methyl and aromatic amines to further expand the range of derivatives of com-pounds 3. But unfortunately, acceptable results were not obtained and the efficiency of many of them was below 20%. Some of these results are shown in Table 2. Fortunately, we succeeded in synthesizing eight different derivatives of tetra-cyclic fused heterocycles 3a–3h. In another experiment, the reaction of methyl-α-arylaminomaleimides 1 with 4-chloro-3-formyl coumarin 2′ under the same conditions (ethanol solvent, reflux temperature, and trimethylamine base) was investigated. The remarkable thing observed in this study is that the reaction was carried out in a pseudo-three-component manner and to complete the reaction, we had to add two equivalents of N-methyl-α-arylaminomaleimides 1 to the reac-tion mixture. As shown in Table 3, by replacing the electron-withdrawing substituent (such as chlorine) on the aryl ring of compound 1, a significant effect on the yield and reaction time of the 3d product was observed. Moreover, this limitation is more obvious with the substitution of alkylamines on the maleimide substrate. The structures of the synthesized com-pounds were characterized by FT-IR, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and NMR. Regarding compound 3′d, unfortunately, we could not perform the 13C NMR analysis due to its very low solubility in the solvent. In addition, the struc-ture of 3b was verified by single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis (Fig. 2). Based on the experimental results and the lit-erature, a plausible mechanism for the synthesis of 3 and 3′ was proposed, as shown in Scheme 2. It can be assumed that initially compound 1 is converted into anion A under triethylamine. Then, the resonance struc-tures of the conjugated enolate facilitate its nucleophilic attack on 2 to produce intermediate B. Finally, by the process of amine–enamine tautomerization, intermediate B is converted into C. Following this, the intramolecular aza-Michael addition of intermediate C results in the formation of the tetracyclic heterocycle 3. The mechanism of formation of compound 3′ is as follows. First, α-C of α-aminomaleimide anion A′ which contains two other resonance structures (conjugated enolate) can easily attack C-4 of 2′ to give intermediate D. Then, by the process of amine–enamine tautomerization, intermediate D is converted into E. Following this, the intramolecular aza-Michael addition of intermediate E via a 1,4-nucleophilic addition process results in the formation of intermediate F. Then, intermediate F with the elimination of an OH anion is converted into the iminium ion (intermediate G). Finally, through the attack of the second molecule of α-aminomaleimide 1 on the iminium ion (intermediate G), intermediate H is formed and by the imine–amine tautomerization of intermediate H, the hetero-cyclic compound 3′ is produced. Conclusions In summary, we have presented a novel domino-type process for the synthesis of dihydrochromeno[3,4-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyri-dines through a base-mediated nucleophilic substitution/ Michael addition/N-cyclization and elimination reaction of 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins with α-aminomaleimides. It is noteworthy that in this process, various products were obtained by changing the substitution at position 3 (3-formyl/ 3-vinyl) of 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins (2 and 2′). Carbon– carbon bonds and a carbon–nitrogen bond were formed in this reaction, and highly stable four-ring aromatic products were obtained. This unprecedented strategy was carried out under relatively green conditions and the results of this effort were derivatives of maleimide-fused chromenopyridines. Until today there is no report about their synthesis. We hope that the obtained products will be of pharmacological interest.

        "Base-promoted synthesis of dihydrochromeno [4,3-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridines from 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins and α-aminomaleimides†This paper describes the base-mediated cascade reactions of 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins with α-aminomaleimides, allowing the efficient synthesis of dihydrochromeno[4,3-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridines with interesting chemoselectivity. These transformations include the domino-style formation of C–C/C– N bonds through a base-mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, N-cyclization, and elimin-ation. The presented synthetic strategy has several advantages: it is simple, uses readily available starting materials and an environmentally friendly solvent, has a highly chemoselective route, and allows the purification of products via washing with EtOH (96%), a technique called GAP (Group-Assisted-Purification) chemistry.",
        "Maleimides, one of the five members of the family of N-heterocyclic pharmacophores with two carbonyl groups adja-cent to the nitrogen atom, are useful building blocks for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. Maleimides also describes a class of derivatives of the parent maleimide where the NH group is replaced with alkyl or aryl groups such as a methyl or phenyl, respectively. The substitu-ent can also be a small molecule (for example, biotin, a fluo-rescent dye, an oligosaccharide, or a nucleic acid).1 These com-pounds exhibit a variety of interesting pharmaceutical pro-perties, including antiepileptic (ethosuximide), anxiolytic and antidepressant (tandospirone), and antipsychotic (perospir-one) properties.2,3 Also, certain anti-inflammatory compounds contain these targeted heterocycles.4 In addition, many N-substituted maleimides possess activities such as antitu-mor,5 antiviral,6 antimicrobial,7 anti-fungal,8 and insecticidal (larvicidal) activities. Maleimides are also important building blocks for the synthesis of high-performance polymers.9 The most common representatives of this class of chemicals are α-aminomaleimides, which have become increasingly popular in organic synthesis. A notable characteristic of α-aminomaleimides is their highly polarized ethylene system in which electron-donating (amino group) and electron-with-drawing (two carbonyl groups) substituents are found on either end. Thus, reactions of α-aminomaleimides with diverse bis-electrophiles have been extensively studied as methods for constructing nitrogen-containing heterocycles or fused hetero-cycles. Among them, the syntheses of pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridines,10 trifluoromethylated pyrazol-4-yl-pyrrole-2,5-diones,11 pyrrolo[3,4-d]tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives,12 and pyrrolo[3,4-b]quino-lones13 are interesting examples. A special property of malei-mides is their susceptibility to additions across the double bond via Michael additions11,14 or Diels–Alder reactions.15 On the other hand, coumarin is considered a promising scaffold in medicinal and biological chemistry, because it is present as a part of the structure of the nucleus in many med-icinally active organic substances.16 Therefore, one of the most popular areas in synthetic organic chemistry is the develop-ment of effective methods for preparing molecules based on coumarin.17–19 The literature demonstrates that chromenopyridines and hetero-fused chromenopyridines are effective bioactive cores in diverse synthetic and natural compounds. Some representative examples of the biological and photo-physical properties of chromenopyridines and hetero-fused chromenopyridines are shown in Fig. 1. In a review, Núñez-Vergara and his colleagues have introduced chromenopyri-dines as privileged skeletons in medicinal and biological chemistry. They have fully described the processes involved in synthesizing these skeletons and their biological properties.20 So far, many attempts have been made to synthesize hetero-fused chromenopyridines. For example, Magedov et al. have reported the synthesis of 2,3-dihydrochromeno[4,3-d]pyrazolo [3,4-b]pyridin-1,6-diones with antibacterial properties.21 Similarly, Choudhury et al. have reported a three-component†Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Experimental and com-putational details; single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis; 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

        "reaction for the synthesis of dihydrochromeno[4,3-b]pyrazolo [4,3-e]pyridin-6(7H)-ones using 4-hydroxycoumarin as the key starting material and using iodine as the catalyst.22 Recently, we also reported the synthesis of dihydro-6H-chromeno[4,3-d] pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-6-ones from the reaction of 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarins and 3-amino pyrazoles under mild con-ditions with acceptable efficiency.23 The possibility of a wide range of biological and physical properties makes chromeno-pyridines interesting synthetic targets.",
        "As a result, the development of straightforward and flexible synthetic methods toward functionalized chromenopyridines has attracted much attention from organic chemists. Perhaps for this reason, it is necessary to develop new methods to increase the structural complexity while reducing the number of synthetic steps to facilitate the construction of new chromenopyridines.",
        "However, there are no reports on the synthesis of tetra-cyclic dihydrochromeno[4,3-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine deriva-tives via reactions of α-aminomaleimides with 4-chloro-3-sub-stituted coumarins. Herein, we envisioned that the chemical entity tetracyclic dihydrochromeno[4,3-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyri-dines, with a hybrid structure involving chromone, pyridine, and maleimide motifs, may possess significant biological features.",
        "Recently, 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins have been attract-ing the attention of organic chemists as the most reactive elec-trophiles and the most readily available starting materials for the synthesis of heterocyclic systems based on coumarins.24 Our group has shown great interest in investigating multicom-ponent reactions using this targeted heterocycle. Using it, we produced new complex molecular scaffolds containing the coumarin skeleton.25 Here, we turn our attention to the devel-opment of a two-component reaction using 4-chloro-3-formyl (3-vinyl)coumarins with α-aminomaleimides to access novel complex molecular scaffolds containing coumarin with poten-tial bioactivity. In the beginning, α-aminomaleimide was pre-pared based on a known method.12 Then, with our previous knowledge, we focused on the preparation of 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarins 2 and 4-chloro-3-formyl coumarin 2′.23 α-Aminomaleimide 1 (1.0 equiv.) and 4-chloro-3-vinyl cou-marin 2 or 2′ (1.0 equiv.) in the presence of 50 mol% triethyl-amine and ethanol as the solvent were stirred at 80 °C in an oil bath for more than 12 h. As a result, 3 or 3′ was formed as a red solid (41–92% yield) and filtered (Scheme 1). After the confirmation of the structure of 3a, we tried to find a suitable base and solvent for the model reaction. The results are summarized in Table 1. The reaction was studied in the presence of 10, 20, and 40 mol% of triethylamine as the base in ethanol and the yields obtained were 25, 40, and 60%, respectively (entries 1–3, Table 1). After changing the ratio of triethylamine to 50 mol%, the yield of the pure product was increased to 88% in ethanol. In the next step, the influence of different bases on the reaction outcome was investigated. The yield of the reaction in the pres-ence of DBU was 30%, which indicated no good signs of 3a forming.",
        "Also, when piperidine with relatively more nucleophilicity was used for this process, product 3a was not formed, probably because of the nucleophilic replacement of piperidine with the chlorine atom of substrate 2a (Table 1, entry 7). The yield of the reaction in the presence of K2CO3 and CS2CO3 as a base was 40 and 50%, respectively. The effect of different solvents (EtOH, MeOH, DCM, and MeCN) on the progress of the reac-tion was investigated. As shown in Table 1, carrying out the reaction in EtOH was found to be the best choice as it resulted in a better yield (88%). Based on this data, the optimized reac-tion conditions were as follows: using 50 mmol% of Et3N in ethanol at 80 °C in an oil bath. The use of a protic solvent (EtOH and MeOH) seems essential for the reaction to proceed and may be related to the dipole moment as well as the hydro-gen bonding ability of protic solvents. With the optimal reac-tion conditions in hand, we began to investigate the generalityand substrate scope of this process. We probed the scope of the annulation with different arylamines. It is noteworthy that the electronic nature of the substituent on the aromatic ringsof α-aminomaleimides and 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarins affected the time of the reaction and the yields of products 3a–3h. It was clear that the reaction yield with α-aminomaleimides con-taining electron-donating groups on the aromatic rings such as Me and OMe substituents was better compared to electron-withdrawing groups such as Cl. It is noteworthy that the reac-tion of N-methyl-α-arylaminomaleimide 1a and NO2-substi-tuted 4-chloro-3-vinyl coumarin 2e did not proceed well and several overlapping spots were observed. This result may be related to the strong electron-withdrawing property of the nitro group, which reduces the electron density through induction and resonance effects. In addition, the nitro substituent can stabilize the negative charges formed at different stages of this process and prevent the reaction from progressing. Notably,attempts to synthesize the nitro-substituted N-methyl-α-aminomalemide were not successful. In addition, we replaced other alkylamines with N-methyl and aromatic amines to further expand the range of derivatives of com-pounds 3. But unfortunately, acceptable results were not obtained and the efficiency of many of them was below 20%. Some of these results are shown in Table 2. Fortunately, we succeeded in synthesizing eight different derivatives of tetra-cyclic fused heterocycles 3a–3h. In another experiment, the reaction of methyl-α-arylaminomaleimides 1 with 4-chloro-3-formyl coumarin 2′ under the same conditions (ethanol solvent, reflux temperature, and trimethylamine base) was investigated. The remarkable thing observed in this study is that the reaction was carried out in a pseudo-three-component manner and to complete the reaction, we had to add two equivalents of N-methyl-α-arylaminomaleimides 1 to the reac-tion mixture. As shown in Table 3, by replacing the electron-withdrawing substituent (such as chlorine) on the aryl ring of compound 1, a significant effect on the yield and reaction time of the 3d product was observed. Moreover, this limitation is more obvious with the substitution of alkylamines on the maleimide substrate. The structures of the synthesized com-pounds were characterized by FT-IR, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and NMR. Regarding compound 3′d, unfortunately, we could not perform the 13C NMR analysis due to its very low solubility in the solvent. In addition, the struc-ture of 3b was verified by single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis (Fig. 2). Based on the experimental results and the lit-erature, a plausible mechanism for the synthesis of 3 and 3′ was proposed, as shown in Scheme 2. It can be assumed that initially compound 1 is converted into anion A under triethylamine. Then, the resonance struc-tures of the conjugated enolate facilitate its nucleophilic attack on 2 to produce intermediate B. Finally, by the process of amine–enamine tautomerization, intermediate B is convertedinto C. Following this, the intramolecular aza-Michael addition of intermediate C results in the formation of the tetracyclic heterocycle 3.",
        "The mechanism of formation of compound 3′ is as follows. First, α-C of α-aminomaleimide anion A′ which contains two other resonance structures (conjugated enolate) can easily attack C-4 of 2′ to give intermediate D. Then, by the process of amine–enamine tautomerization, intermediate D is converted into E. Following this, the intramolecular aza-Michael addition of intermediate E via a 1,4-nucleophilic addition process results in the formation of intermediate F. Then, intermediate F with the elimination of an OH anion is converted into the iminium ion (intermediate G). Finally, through the attack of the second molecule of α-aminomaleimide 1 on the iminium ion (intermediate G), intermediate H is formed and by the imine–amine tautomerization of intermediate H, the hetero-cyclic compound 3′ is produced.",
        "In summary, we have presented a novel domino-type process for the synthesis of dihydrochromeno[3,4-d]pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyri-dines through a base-mediated nucleophilic substitution/ Michael addition/N-cyclization and elimination reaction of 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins with α-aminomaleimides. It is noteworthy that in this process, various products were obtained by changing the substitution at position 3 (3-formyl/ 3-vinyl) of 4-chloro-3-substituted coumarins (2 and 2′). Carbon– carbon bonds and a carbon–nitrogen bond were formed in this reaction, and highly stable four-ring aromatic products were obtained. This unprecedented strategy was carried out under relatively green conditions and the results of this effort were derivatives of maleimide-fused chromenopyridines. Until today there is no report about their synthesis. We hope that the obtained products will be of pharmacological interest.",
        "Experimental General information All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates. The temperatures were monitored using a mercury laboratory thermometer. Melting points were measured on an Electrothermal 9100 apparatus. IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a Nicolet FT-IR 100 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR (300 MHz) and 13C{1H} NMR (75 MHz) spectra were obtained using Bruker DRX-500 Avance and Bruker DRX-300 Avance spectrometers. All NMR spectra were recorded at r.t. in DMSO-d6. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ) downfield from an internal TMS reference. Coupling constants ( J values) are reported in hertz (Hz), and standard abbreviations are used to indicate spin multiplicities. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were performed using a Heraeus CHN-O-Rapid analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan-MATT 8430 mass spectro-meter operating at an ionization potential of 70 eV. Single crys-tals of compound 3b were formed in the mixture of CH2Cl2 and absolute EtOH (1 : 1 v/v).",
