Zetterlund *a A multiblock copolymer is a polymer of a specific structure that consists of multiple covalently linked segments, each comprising a different monomer type. The control of the monomer sequence has often been described as the ‘‘holy grail’’ of synthetic polymer chemistry, with the ultimate goal being synthetic access to polymers of a ‘‘perfect’’ structure, where each monomeric building block is placed at a desired position along the polymer chain. Given that polymer properties are intimately linked to the microstructure and monomer distribution along the constituent chains, it goes without saying that there exist seemingly endless opportunities in terms of fine-tuning the properties of such materials by careful consideration of the length of each block, the number and order of blocks, and the inclusion of monomers with specific functional groups. The area of multiblock copolymer synthesis remains relatively unexplored, in particular with regard to structure–property relationships, and there are currently significant opportunities for the design and synthesis of advanced materials. The present review focuses on the synthesis of multiblock copolymers via reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization implemented as aqueous emulsion polymerization. RAFT emulsion polymerization offers intriguing opportunities not only for the advanced synthesis of multiblock copolymers, but also provides access to polymeric nanoparticles of specific morphologies. Precise multiblock copolymer synthesis coupled with self-assembly offers material morphology control on length scales ranging from a few nanometers to a micrometer. It is imperative that polymer chemists interact with physicists and material scientists to maximize the impact of these materials of the future. 1. Introduction A multiblock copolymer comprises three or more covalently linked segments of different monomer compositions (blocks).1–3 There exist seemingly endless opportunities in terms of fine-tuning the properties of such materials by careful consideration of the length of each individual block, the number of blocks, the order of blocks, and the inclusion of monomers with specific functional groups. The control of monomer sequence in polymers is one of the most important quests in contemporary polymer chemistry, with researchers striving to mimic the ability of Nature to access polymers with a ‘‘perfect’’ structure.4–6 Biopolymers such as nucleic acids and proteins exhibit specia-lized functions originating in the perfectly controlled sequence distribution of monomer units and functionalities along the chain. As such, multiblock copolymers can be regarded as an important stepping-stone in this direction. Multiblock copolymers are entirely different materials from the corres-ponding mixtures of the constituent homopolymers – this is particularly evident in the case where polymer self-assembly results in microphase separation into discrete nano-sized domains (5–100 nm). The microphase separation of chemically incompatible blocks occurs when the molecular weights of the individual blocks are sufficiently high. In contrast, mixing of the corresponding chemically incompatible homopolymers results in macrophase separation on a bulk scale, and does not generate spatially periodic compositional nanostructural patterns. Precise multiblock copolymer synthesis coupled with self-assembly offers morphology control on length scales ran-ging from a few nanometers up to a micrometer. The area of multiblock copolymer synthesis from a materials science per-spective remains relatively unexplored with enormous oppor-tunities for the future development of advanced materials and applications.1–3 Given the endless possibilities of designing a Cluster for Advanced Macromolecular Design (CAMD), School of Chemical Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

Self-assembly of diblock copoly-mers has found applications in nanomedicine (e.g. drug delivery), microelectronic devices,7 and advanced plastics.1,2,8,9 Multiblock copolymers can be synthesized using a variety of approaches involving methods based on reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP),10–12 click-like chemistries, and polyaddition or polycondensation.6 The focus of the present review is multiblock copolymer synthesis in aqueous emulsion polymerization using what is arguably the most versatile form of RDRP, namely reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization (Fig. 1).13–15 RDRP has had a dramatic impact on polymer chemistry, rendering hitherto inaccessible polymer structures possible, notably block copoly-mers. In regard to multiblock copolymer synthesis, it was reported in 201116 that the exploitation of an RDRP system with extremely high livingness (end-group fidelity) makes it possible to access multiblock copolymers via iterative polymer-izations to essentially full conversion in a one-pot process, thus eliminating the need for intermediate purification steps. This pioneering work, which uses Cu(0)-mediated radical polymer-ization (also known as SET-LRP or SARA-ATRP) inspired further developments using RAFT polymerization,17–21 demonstrating that high-order multiblock copolymers comprising as many as 20 blocks could be synthesized using RAFT polymerization, exploiting monomers with high propagation rate coefficients (kp) such as acrylates and acrylamides. The process of emulsion polymerization22 entails polymer-ization occurring within monomer-swollen micelles/polymer particles on a nanodimensional scale, so-called nanoreactors.

This in turn leads to a reduction in the rate of bimolecular termination between propagating species relative to that observed in a corresponding homogeneous system (bulk/ solution), and thus a higher polymerization rate.25,34,36–38 The degree of livingness (and chain-end fidelity) in RAFT polymeriza-tion, for a given degree of polymerization, can be markedly increased relative to the corresponding homogeneous bulk or solution systems.39 The substantially higher polymerization rate in a compartmentalized system makes it possible to reach a given degree of polymerization in a significantly shorter time. As a consequence, fewer initiating radicals are required for polymeriza-tion, leading to higher livingness.17–20,40 Therefore, this approach makes possible the preparation of multiblock copolymers com-prising low kp monomers such as styrenes and methacrylates. 39–41 In addition, aqueous emulsion polymerization is more environ-mentally friendly and suitable for industrial scale up, enabling easy access to the large scale synthesis of advanced functional materials.22 Emulsion polymerization yields a polymer product in the form of discrete polymer nanoparticles dispersed in water (a so-called latex). Such latices can often be directly applied in various applications, such as in paints and coatings. Moreover, the experimental access to polymer nanoparticles is of great signifi-cance – polymer nanoparticles find a wide range of applications. The morphology of polymer nanoparticles plays a key role in their properties, and multiblock copolymer nanoparticles offer interest-ing opportunities in terms of tuning of particle morphology. The present review aims to summarize the state of the art in the area of multiblock copolymer synthesis (focussing on block numbers greater than 3) and the preparation of multiblock copolymer particles (including morphological aspects) using aqueous RAFT emulsion polymerization. Significant attention is given to mechanistic/kinetic aspects that set these systems apart from their counterparts in solution or bulk RAFT poly-merization. More specifically, this review will first deal with the fundamentals of RAFT polymerization, before delving into recent advances related to the mechanistic nuances of RAFT in heterogeneous systems. This is followed by a summary of all work involved in synthesizing multiblock copolymers via RAFT mediated heterogeneous polymerization and relevant work in the periphery, finally followed by a discussion on the interplay between multiblock copolymers and particle morphology. A more general review on the synthesis of multiblock copoly-mers has been published by Becer et al.,42 while a review focussing on both sequence-controlled and sequence-defined polymers has been published by Junkers et al.6 These are relevant to the current body of work as they deal with multi-block synthesis and recognise the significance of emulsion polymerization.

This review seeks to fill such gaps through an overview of the fundamental mechanisms and deconstruction of advancements in this field, many of which have come to light only recently. 2. RAFT polymerization The history, mechanism and application of the RAFT process have been described in numerous reviews and we only note some of the more recent here.15,43–47 RAFT polymerization, involving so-called macromonomer RAFT agents, was first reported in 1995 as a new form of controlled-growth radical polymerization for forming low dispersity (multi)block copoly-mers by (semi-batch) polymerization.48–50 The more popular form of RAFT polymerization using carbonothioylsulfanyl com-pounds (more commonly called thiocarbonylthio compounds, but this nomenclature is deprecated by IUPAC) as RAFT agents was announced in 1998.13,15 The public announcement was preceded by patent submissions by CSIRO/DuPont51,52 and Rhodia.53 A review on the historical development of RAFT has been published.50 IUPAC defines RAFT polymerization as a ‘‘degenerate-transfer radical polymerization in which chain activation and chain deactivation involve a degenerative chain-transfer pro-cess, which occurs by a two-step addition-fragmentation mechanism’’.54,55 Degenerate-transfer radical polymerization is then a ‘‘reversible-deactivation polymerization in which the deactivation of the active species involves degenerative chain transfer’’,56 and degenerative (or degenerate) chain transfer is a ‘‘chain-transfer reaction that generates a new chain carrier and a new chain-transfer agent with the same reactivity as the original chain carrier and chain-transfer agent’’.56 The essential features of the RAFT mechanism can be seen in Scheme 1. The chain transfer reactions are called degenerate given that the process entails the propagating radicals (R–PnNone) exchanging functionality with the dormant macroRAFT agents [R–Pm–XC(QX)Z]. The only distinction between the reactants and products is their respective chain lengths (n and m). As long as the rate coefficients for forward and reverse chain transfers are high, the n and m values should likewise be similar. To achieve a low Ð polymer, ideally, substantially fewer than one monomer unit will be added per activation cycle. The RAFT agent 1 and macroRAFT agent 2 (refer Scheme 2) are reactively symmetrical. The group X is usually sulfur (in carbonothioylsulfanyl RAFT agents),13 but carbon (in macro-monomer RAFT agents or sulfur-free RAFT)48–50,57 and other examples have been reported. The RAFT agent Z substituent is generally called an activating group and determines the reac-tivity of the CQS or CQC bond towards radical addition alongside the stability of the intermediates. R or R–Pn groups are the groups transferred as a consequence of RAFT. The respective radicals (R or R–PnNone) must be an effective homolytic leaving group and efficiently re-initiate polymerization to become new propagating radicals. The overall RAFT process subsequently revolves around sequential monomer unit inser-tion as indicated in Scheme 2. The R– and Z(X)CQX– function-alities of the initial RAFT agent are located at the ends of the 3442 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023new macroRAFT agent. Note, however, that the RAFT process ensures that the R– and Z(X)CQX– functionalities will typically not derive from the same initial RAFT agent molecule. The ‘intermediates’ in Scheme 1 should only be transient and, in most circumstances, do not directly affect the process. However, termination involving the intermediates is generally believed the likely cause of retardation observed in many RAFT polymeriza-tions. Propagation from the intermediate (i.e., copolymerization of the RAFT agent) by the reaction of the intermediate with the monomer is a complication in macromonomer RAFT polymeriza-tion involving monosubstituted monomers. The RAFT process does not lead to radical generation. Consequently, RAFT polymerization must be initiated by a separate initiation step. Historically, this has most often involved the thermal decomposition of an added initiator. However, initiating radicals may also be generated mechani-cally, photochemically58 or in a redox process59 directly from the RAFT agent. All radical species generated in the RAFT mechanism can, in principle, be involved in the RAFT process to form new RAFT species or terminate by radical–radical reactions. To minimize termination events, the careful selection of reaction conditions is required. Minimizing termination for polymerizations in homogeneous solutions typically requires the targeted molecular weight to be considerably smaller than that in a comparable conventional radical polymerization. The formation of new, less active, RAFT agents from initiator-derived radicals or initiating radicals with the initial RAFT agent is also a potential cause of retardation.60 The transfer coefficients (Ctr) of the initial RAFT agent are often such that o1 monomer unit will be inserted per activation cycle. These Ctr are substantially higher than those of the macroRAFT agents formed after monomer insertion. As a result, initial RAFT agents are typically transformed to single-unit monomer insertion (SUMI) products prior to any signifi-cant formation of higher molar mass macroRAFT agents (Scheme 2).61–65 This can result in an initial period of slow monomer consumption if the value of the rate coefficient for the addition of the RNone radical to the monomer is less than the propagation rate coefficient of the monomer.

Gener-ally, it is applicable to classify monomers into one of the two main classes.66,67 The double bond of ‘less activated’ mono-mers or LAMs is adjacent to a saturated carbon or one or more halogen, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur lone pairs. A less stabilised or more reactive propagating species is formed by radical addition to LAMs. The double bond of ‘more-activated’ mono-mers or MAMs is conjugated to an unsaturated system such as an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, a nitrile, or a double bond. This category of MAMs also includes maleic anhydride (MAH) and maleimides. A more stabilized propagating species is formed by radical addition to MAMs. Monomers that fall between the boundaries of MAMs and LAMs such as N-vinyl-carbazole (NVC) can be classed as intermediate activated monomers or an IAM.68 In any case, with a judicious choice of the RAFT agent, most monomers are compatible with RAFT polymerization, whether they be LAMs, MAMs, or IAMs. 2.2. RAFT agents The design, selection and synthesis of RAFT agents have been described in many recent reviews.14,66,67,69–71 RAFT agent selec-tion (ZC(QS)SR or ZC(QCH2)CH2R) for specific monomer(s) and reaction conditions is vital for achieving defined molar mass dispersities and high end-group fidelity. The number of publications mentioning the various RAFT agents is displayed in Fig. 2, and is indicative of their overall popularity. The structure of a given RAFT agent, ZC(QS)SR or ZC(QCH2)CH2R, specifically the activating group, Z, and the homolytic leaving group, R, establishes its effectiveness in facilitating radical polymerization. General recommendations for substituent selection are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively.66,71 The Z-group has a considerable impact on the transfer coefficient of RAFT agents. While there are a large range of possible Z-groups, it should be noted71 that, with only two differing types of the RAFT Z-group, one for MAMs (e.g., a trithiocarbonate) and another for LAMs (e.g., a xanthate), con-trol over the polymerization of the majority of monomers should be possible.71 The homolytic leaving group RNone of the initial RAFT agent (ZC(QS)SR) should also be an effective initiating radical in regard to the monomer(s) to be polymerized.66,67 The rate coefficient for the addition of RNone to the monomer, ki, generally ought to be at least equivalent to the rate of propagation (kp). Values of ki for some common RNone have been summarized. 73 Systems where kp is significantly higher than ki can undergo a period of inhibition, during which the RAFT agent from its initial state is fully transformed into a macroRAFT agent. This behaviour is represented by the dashed lines present in Fig. 4. 2.3. Sequence defined polymers – synthesis of (multi)block copolymers Di-, tri-and multi-blocks can be synthesized by sequential monomer addition.67,71,74,75 Attaining high end-group fidelity and block purity are of high importance; factors that influence the former generally strongly affect the latter.74 The formation of an A–B diblock copolymer with conventional initiation is considered. A population of initiator-derived chains will be generated throughout the polymerization of the first block. These are distinguished by the presence of an initiator frag-ment (I–) as the end-group instead of the RAFT agent R–group (Scheme 3). Since chains are initiated throughout the duration of polymerization, the initiator-derived chains are typically characterized by a lower Mn and a higher Ð than what is ideal for the A-block (i.e., a lower molar mass tailing is observed). Given that all chains equilibrate up to the point where termina-tion occurs, this means that the chains formed with initiator derived ends will not be the same chains that undergo termina-tion. The initiator-derived chain impurities can be removed by choosing an initiator and an initial RAFT agent such that I– and R– are the same. The initiator-derived chain impurities can also be removed by using direct photo-iniferter RAFT, photo-induced electron/energy transfer–RAFT (PET–RAFT), redox RAFT or eRAFT wherein radicals are generated directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent. The latter strategies reduce but do not completely eliminate termination as a side reaction. To the extent that termination occurs, there must exist further by-products formed due to the RAFT agent ZCS2 frag-ment. Unlike RAFT with conventional initiation, the amount of termination may be mitigated by the persistent radical effect. For every two chains initiated, between one and two dead chains will eventually be formed depending on the extent of 3444 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023termination by combination vs. disproportionation. In making an AB diblock, termination during the polymerization of A-block will result in the formation of dead chains of homo-polymer A. Throughout the synthesis of the B-block, initiator-derived chains are formed, and will constitute an impurity composed of homopolymer B (Scheme 3). Termination via combination during the synthesis of the B-block will lead to the formation of some ABA triblocks. In synthesizing higher order block copolymers (tri-and multi-blocks), progressive generations beget higher degrees of complexity.21 For monomers with a high kp such as acrylates and acryl-amides, only a low initiator concentration is required to achieve high polymerization rates. As a result, high (e.g., 499%) monomer conversions can be attained within an acceptable timeframe whilst maintaining the RAFT end-group fidelity. This approach was applied advantageously for the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers containing a poly(octadecyl acry-late) (PODA) block,76 where the removal of residual ODA would be laborious and difficult. A similar strategy has been used in multi-block copolymer synthesis.17,18,21,77 Nonetheless, it is typically desirable for most homogenous media polymeriza-tions to be limited in monomer conversion, e.g., o90%, so as to maximize end-group fidelity, being especially crucial where low kp monomers such as styrenes and methacrylates are involved. At higher monomer conversions, the importance of termination events progressively increases. As a result, when intermediate purification steps between each block is undesir-able, such as when using high-throughput methods,78–80 it is more convenient to conduct the sequential addition of mono-mers whilst unreacted monomers from the previous block still remains. This compromise leads to the formation of what are called quasi-block copolymers.78,81 When two distinct mono-mers A and B are employed, the resultant ‘‘quasi-block’’ will be a gradient copolymer [i.e., P(A)-b-P(A-grad-B)], with the mono-mer reactivity ratios affecting the exact composition of the ‘‘quasi-block’’. The ‘‘quasi-block’’ composition may have detri-mental impacts on the desired polymer properties, especially in applications such as electronics, where the block purity is of the upmost importance, and thus must be accounted for when designing polymer syntheses. The factors that dictate the R-group selection also determine the order of block construction in block copolymer syntheses. It is necessary for the propagating species generated from the initial block (PANone) to be a good homolytic leaving group in regard to that of the following block (PBNone). The PANone radical from the block generated initially must undergo an efficient addition to B monomer(s) that the following block will be composed of. For instance, in the synthesis of a diblock comprising polystyrene and poly(vinyl acetate), P(St-b-VAc), the PStNone adds VAc only slowly.82 This results in a very slow consumption of This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3445the PSt macroRAFT. Moreover, any residual St causes signifi-cant retardation. The problem can be solved by forming a short block of methyl acrylate (MA) between the PSt and PVAc blocks to form PSt-b-PMA-b-PVAc.82,83 The length of the PMA block should be designed such that at least a single MA unit is at the end of every chain, and all residual St is consumed. An alternate solution is to copolymerize VAc with a small amount of MA. The reactivity ratios between St/MA and MA/VAc will lead to the overall composition being PSt-b-(PMA-grad-PVAc)-b-PVAc.82,83 Another method of successfully synthesizing block copoly-mers with the ‘‘wrong’’ monomer-order, or when using macro-RAFT agents with low transfer coefficients, is through the use of starved-feed addition protocol.84,85 The protocol was used to prepare a diblock comprising polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate), PSt-b-PMMA, St block first, and with 11 as the initial RAFT agent. In this example, semi-batch emulsion con-ditions with continuous slow monomer addition maintained the instantaneous monomer conversion between 80 and 95%.86 The consumption rate of an initial RAFT or macroRAFT agent in RAFT polymerization may be estimated via the following expression (eqn (1)): d½RCS2ZNone d½MNone None Ctr ½RCS2ZNone ½MNone þ Ctr½RCS2ZNone þ CNonetr½RPnCS2ZNone (1) where Ctr (= [kadd/(kNoneadd + kb]/kp) and CNonetr (= [kNoneb/(kNoneadd + kb)]/ki) are the forward and reverse transfer coefficients relevant to the initialization process (refer Scheme 1). These complexities in block copolymer synthesis in bulk or solution has provided much impetus for the further development of block copolymer synthesis in dispersed sys-tems. This same approach was also utilized in earlier work for the preparation of block copolymers exhibiting low dispersities from macromonomer RAFT agents.48,49 This strategy is dis-cussed further in Sections 3.2 and 4.1.87 3. RAFT polymerization in dispersed systems 3.1. Emulsion polymerization Radical polymerization can be conducted as a homogeneous system (solution/bulk) or as a dispersed system. There are a number of different types of dispersed systems,88 namely emulsion polymerization,22 miniemulsion polymerization,89 microemulsion polymerization,90,91 precipitation polymeriza-tion, dispersion polymerization,92,93 and suspension polymer-ization. Some of these systems may seem similar, and there is considerable confusion and lack of consistency in the scientific literature in regard to terminology, in particular regarding emulsion and miniemulsion polymerization.94 Importantly, the systems listed differ mainly in terms of the particle for-mation mechanism, and consequently also in terms of the final particle size, although there is considerable overlap in regard to the latter. The reader is referred to the literature for detailed explanations and definitions of each system, in particular within the context of RDRP/RAFT.88,95 Emulsion polymeriza-tion is by far the most common and most commercially important of these processes. Emulsion polymerization is attractive for a number of reasons: it is easy to perform, is 3446 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023suitable for industrial scale production, provides high polymer-ization rates and high molecular weights (the latter specifically referring to conventional radical polymerization), and gene-rates the polymer product in the form of polymer nanoparticles dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase (a so-called ‘‘latex’) that can often be used as is, commonly with suitable additives, in the applications of paints and coatings for example. A conventional emulsion polymerization begins with a stirred mixture of water, surfactants, monomers and typically a water-soluble initiator. Particle formation occurs in the aqueous phase (not from monomer droplets as in a miniemulsion polymerization) via micellar or homogeneous nucleation in the approximate conversion range of 0–10% (Interval I). Monomer droplets co-exist with monomer-swollen particles over the approximate conversion range of 10–40% (Interval II) – during this interval, monomer is consumed by propagation in polymer particles, and further the monomer diffuses across the aqueous phase from monomer droplets and is absorbed by polymer particles. At some point, typically around 40% conversion, all monomer droplets have been consumed, and monomer-swollen particles remain where propagation continues. The typical particle size range obtained from an emulsion poly-merization is 100–600 nm with relatively narrow particle size distributions. 3.2. RAFT emulsion polymerization based on self-assembly Conventional emulsion polymerizations are traditionally stabi-lized via the use of surfactants. Issues with superswelling, film formation, degradation of physical properties and environ-mental impact have however galvanized the pursuit of RAFT mediated emulsion polymerizations free of conventional surfactants.11,96–100 The most elegant and convenient way of conducting RAFT emulsion polymerization is to trigger particle nucleation via self-assembly of an amphiphilic macroRAFT species, thereby bypassing the need for a conventional low MW surfactant. Such a macroRAFT species can either be prepared in a separate step (as in Scheme 4) or form as a part of the emulsion polymerization in a one pot process. The latter case has become known as polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA),101–107 and can be implemented using in principle any RDRP system, but RAFT is by far the method of choice to date. However, PISA based on addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) polymerization is also possible.108 Ferguson et al.101,102 reported the first work on PISA in emulsion in 2002, and a few years after that it was realized that PISA can be used to access a range of higher order morphologies such as worms and vesicles.103–107 Such self-assembled systems generally see the R-group and the solvophilic block anchored at the particle interface, while the hydrophobic block extends within the particle. This has been exploited for the synthesis of covalently linked core–shell particles,101,102 and later for the formation of multi-layered particles,109,110 which will be discussed in more detail in Section 5.2. 3.3. Compartmentalization effects (the nanoreactor concept) The kinetics of emulsion polymerizations have long been known to be profoundly influenced by effects of compartmen-talization, i.e. the confinement of the polymerization to small discrete spaces (nanoreactors) as initially set out by Smith-Ewart theory within the framework of so-called zero-one kinetics.22,111 The basic concept of zero-one kinetics is that if particles (nanoreactors) are sufficiently small, the time it takes for two radicals to undergo bimolecular termination within a given particle is so short (confined space effect) that significant This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3447propagation does not occur before a termination event. As such, over any kinetically significant length of time, particles will contain either one or zero radicals. The resultant segrega-tion of propagating radicals between particles means that the overall rate of termination is reduced. For conventional (not RDRP) radical polymerization, this leads to higher polymeriza-tion rates and higher molecular weights than in corresponding homogeneous systems (Fig. 5). The translation of these concepts to RDRP systems is far from trivial, and extensive theoretical work has to date been conducted to clarify how the three most common RDRP systems (RAFT polymerization, atom transfer radical polymer-ization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP)) behave under compartmentalized conditions.34,36 We will here focus exclusively on RAFT polymerization, while noting that compartmentalization effects cannot be treated the same way for degenerative transfer systems (e.g. RAFT) and systems that proceed via the persistent radical effect112 (e.g. ATRP/ NMP). Although there are a range of more subtle kinetic effects of compartmentalization on RAFT polymerization,113–116 the overall effect of the most importance to the subject of multiblock copolymer synthesis in emulsion polymerization is that of the segregation of propagating radicals as alluded to earlier. If two propagating radicals are located in two separate particles, they are unable to undergo bimolecular termination. As such, the overall rate of bimolecular termination is reduced, leading to a higher RAFT polymerization rate for the same reason that a conventional (non-RDRP) radical polymerization is also typically faster in a compartmentalized system. Within the context of multiblock copolymer synthesis, the concept of ‘‘livingness’’, or chain-end fidelity, is crucial. The livingness is defined as the number fraction of chains that contain a RAFT end group capable of undergoing further chain extension. In RAFT polymerization involving an exogenous initiator (unlike PET–RAFT117), the livingness can be directly related to the number of initiator radicals generating new chains, given that every radical generated (before or after undergoing propagation and/or chain transfer events) must ultimately be involved in a termination event, as given by eqn (2): L ¼ CTA½ None0 CTA½ None0þ2f I½ None0 1None eNonekdtð Þ 1None fc 2 None None (2) where [CTA]0 is the initial concentration of chain transfer agent, [I]0 is the initial initiator concentration, and 2f I½ None0ð1None eNonekdtÞ 1None fc 2 None None ) is the total number of radicals origi-nated from the initiator; in this term, f is the initiator effi-ciency, kd is the rate constant for decomposition, and fc is the coupling factor (0 r fc r 1, where a value of 0 represents all termination occurring via disproportionation, and a value of 0 represents all termination occurring via combination). It follows that one seeks to minimize the initiator concen-tration, the obvious trade-off being between livingness and polymerization rate.17–20 Now, given that the segregation effect leads to an increase in polymerization rate, one can use RAFT emulsion polymerization (and other heterogeneous systems such as miniemulsion polymerization) at substantially lower rates of initiation than the corresponding homogeneous system.17–20,39,40 This enables access to considerably higher degrees of livingness in RAFT emulsion polymerization sys-tems, which is crucial for multiblock copolymer synthesis which involves a number of successive chain extensions. In the same way, exploitation of compartmentalization in RAFT emulsion polymerization has enabled the synthesis of multiblock copolymers comprising slowly propagating mono-mers such as styrenes and methacrylates,39–41 which is extre-mely challenging in homogeneous systems due to low polymerization rates requiring high initiation rates leading to low livingness. 3.4. Monomer concentration at a polymerization locus One of the key parameters that dictate the level of control over the MWD in all RDRP systems is the number of monomer units that are added per activation-deactivation cycle. The lower the number of monomer units added by propagation while the 3448 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023polymer chain is in the active state (i.e. in the form of a propagating radical), the lower the value of the dispersity Ð of the MWD.118 The number of monomer units added per activa-tion cycle depends on the rate coefficients for propagation and deactivation, as well as the reactant concentrations (see discussion related to eqn (1) in Section 2.3). In the case of RAFT polymerization, the reactant concentrations of concern are the monomer concentration and the RAFT end group concen-tration. Now, in Interval I and Interval II (see above), emulsion polymerization features the presence of both monomer dro-plets and polymer particles, with polymerization only occurring in the latter while the monomer droplets merely act as mono-mer reservoirs feeding monomers to the particles as monomers is consumed in the particles. The result is that the number of monomer molecules per number of RAFT end groups at the locus of polymerization, i.e. in the polymer particles, is lower than it would be in the corresponding homogeneous system, because the monomer in the monomer droplets is excluded (Fig. 6). As such, theory dictates that this effect would lead to lower Ð in emulsion polymerization than in the corresponding homo-geneous system.41,119 Moad and coworkers reported that low dispersity methacrylate-based copolymers can be prepared from methacrylate macromonomers according to so-called ‘‘sulfur-free RAFT’’ emulsion polymerization performed as the semi-batch process with a continuous monomer feed such that the instantaneous monomer conversion was ca 495%.48,49,84,120 Methacrylate macromonomers exhibit very low Ctr values in comparison with typical RAFT agents, and satisfactory control over the MWD and living character can thus only be obtained under conditions where Ctr is artificially increased by the virtue of a low monomer concentration. This concept also plays a key role in the work reported by Engelis et al.,87 who synthe-sized methacrylate-based multiblock copolymers employing ‘‘sulfur-free RAFT’’ emulsion polymerization with methacrylate macromonomers also using a semi-continuous process with a continuous monomer feed. It has also recently been demon-strated that the in-built monomer feeding mechanism from droplets to the particle phase in emulsion polymerization can be exploited to dramatically improve the performance of polymerizations involving a RAFT agent with relatively low transfer constants (Ctr). 41 It is important to highlight that this in-built effect should be absent in miniemulsion polymeriza-tion due to the fact that monomer droplet nucleation is the dominant particle formation mechanism and there is no discrete droplet phase. 3.5. Initial conformation of macroRAFT The successful chain extension of multiblock copolymers is heavily influenced by the macroRAFT species. There are a number of general factors that contribute to the ‘success’ of a given macroRAFT agent, though not all such factors apply equally for every system. It is important that the precursor macroRAFT retains a high degree of livingness, and as such long inhibition periods are not ideal.95,121 The pH of ab initio emulsion systems mediated by macroRAFT containing PAA or PMAA units has been long known to significantly influence both nucleation time and colloidal stability.102,122–124 Alkaline conditions beget good colloidal stability due to electrostatic repulsion between macroRAFT stabilized particles, generally at the cost of control due to the increased nucleation time (more micelles due to lower critical micelle concentration (CMC)) and/ or hydrolysis of the trithiocarbonate RAFT agent end groups. Acidic conditions generally give inferior colloidal stability but better control; conducting polymerization under acidic condi-tions until nucleation, upon which the system is made alkaline, e.g. with NaOH, has proven successful in mitigating this issue.121 Aqueous phase termination due to radical transfer to stabilizing PAA units may also play a role in extending the nucleation period.121,125 Generally, initiator concentrations and decomposition rates are also important in determining the fraction of living chains.17,126 It is well established that the macroRAFT agents employed in ab initio, surfactant free macro-RAFT mediated aqueous emulsion polymerization, must be water soluble, though not so much such that longer inhibi-tion times and homogenous nucleation start to become significant.127,128 Solubility can be controlled by the choice of monomers and targeted degrees of polymerization for the hydrophilic and, where relevant, hydrophobic blocks. In cases where the macroRAFT species is poorly water soluble, a cosol-vent may be used.129 To achieve water solubility, the macro-RAFT typically contains hydrophilic monomer units such as methacrylic acid (MAA),130–133 acrylic acid (AA),121,134 N,N-di-methylacrylamide,135,136 N-acryloylmorpholine,137 and 2-(dimethyl-amino)ethyl methacrylate.138–140 It is also possible to use RAFT agents with hydrophilic cationic Z-groups in this context.141 After the formation of particles, the hydrophilic segment acts as the colloidal stabilizer. In the synthesis of high molecular weight polymers, as the particle surface area increases with increasing molecular weight, the steric stabilization of the macroRAFT is often not sufficient to prevent colloidal instability in the system, resulting in coagulation. To overcome this issue, This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3449polyelectrolytes such as PMAA40,110,119,142 and PAA109,143,144 are used as the preferred hydrophilic block in both amphiphilic macroRAFT and PISA approaches. In implementing PMAA or PAA macroRAFTs in an emulsion polymerization system, the initial chain conformation of the macroRAFT significantly influences the polymerization success. The conformation of PMAA under acidic conditions (opH = 5.5.) has been shown to be a hyper-coiled aggregate for both short and long chains.130,145–147 Upon increasing the pH above 5.5, a conformation transition from a hyper-coiled state to a water swollen state occurs due to the increase in hydrophilicity caused by deprotonation of MAA units.145,148 Under acidic conditions, PAA has been shown to only adopt a hyper-coiled aggregate state above 16 500 g molNone1.146 Short chains (i.e. less than 5000 g molNone1, generally DP o50), which are most com-monly used in macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymerization, adopt a loosely packed structure. The cause for this difference in the chain conformation is the additional methyl group of MAA, which favours the interior of the hydrophobic domain, thus driving the macroRAFT to adopt a coil structure.145 Fluorescence studies by Thompson et al.147 show that under acidic conditions, the hydrophobicity of the Z-group does not affect the formation of hyper-coiled aggregates for PMAA-TTC based macroRAFTs with molecular weights between 2000 and 10 000 g molNone1. The addition of a hydrophobic block of PMMA to PMAA-TTC macroRAFTs was demonstrated to not affect the chain conformation under acidic conditions. Under conditions above the conformational transition point at pH = 5.5, a hydrophobic domain was still present according to the fluores-cence data. The use of a macroRAFT agent comprising more hydrophobic monomers such as BMA or St instead of MMA may drive the conformation towards a more micellar nature; however, the macroRAFT agent water solubility would be reduced. This would limit the macroRAFT concentration that can be employed in the polymerization, thus reducing the benefit of rapid particle nucleation and minimal particle aggre-gation often observed in systems with micelles.109,134 In contrast to PMAA-TTC, PAA-TTC was shown in fluorescence123,147 and DLS147 data to not adopt the hyper-coiled structure regardless of hydrophobicity of the Z-group. The addition of a small hydro-phobic block of PSt to the PAA-TTC macroRAFT does cause a change in the conformation. Fluorescence and DLS studies indicate that the macroRAFT adopts a micellar structure with a PSt hydrophobic domain. This micellar structure is present under both acidic and basic conditions.147 The presence of a hydrophobic domain (a hyper-coiled aggregate comprising a few chains) has a drastic effect on the mechanism of RAFT emulsion PISA polymerization. The hyper-coiled aggregation adopted by PMAA-TTC macroRAFT agents at low pH leads to an increased hydrophobic monomer concen-tration around the RAFT moiety in the initial reaction medium.123,130,131 This favours rapid chain extension, which leads to the polymer chains reaching the critical length to undergo nucleation with only a short induction period.131 In the case of PMAA-TTC macroRAFT at higher pH130 or PAA-TTC-based macroRAFTs123,131 where no significant hydrophobic domains are present, the concentration of hydrophobic mono-mers in the vicinity of active chains is markedly reduced. This leads to a much slower growth of the hydrophobic block. Additionally, the more open water-swollen structure indicates that a longer hydrophobic block is needed before self-assembly can occur, and also increases the likelihood of hydrolysis of the RAFT agent. These factors all contribute to these systems having a long induction period. In amphiphilic macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymeriza-tion, the particle nucleation mechanism can vary depending on the nature of the macroRAFT. A commonly employed macro-RAFT in the literature is PAA-b-PSt-TTC.109,121,134,143,144 As mentioned above, this macroRAFT adopts a micellar struc-ture in water and as a result, the particle nucleation occurs via micellar nucleation. Huang et al.134 reported the successful synthesis of PSt seed latexes employing PAA-b-PSt-TTC with varying block lengths of PAA and PSt. Full conversion was reached within two hours with little to no induction period observed. The short induction period and colloidal stability of the micelles lead to less particle aggregation relative to compar-able PISA systems, resulting in a smaller particle size.109 The disadvantages of this macroRAFT are the laborious purification process to synthesize the macroRAFT, as well as the lower livingness (chain end functionality) of the macroRAFT com-pared to the corresponding PAA or PMAA macroRAFTs dis-cussed above.149 Khan et al.110,119 and Clothier et al.40,142 employed PMAA-b-PMMA-TTC to synthesize a variety of methacrylate-based seed latexes. The initial conformation under acidic conditions is similar to that of PMAA-TTC hydro-philic macroRAFTs and the particle nucleation mechanism is similar as well. The presence of the PMMA block however limits the macroRAFT concentration at which seed latexes can be synthesized – the macroRAFT only has limited solubility in water and as a consequence, systems employing PMAA-b-PMMA-TTC cannot have as high solid contents as PMAA-TTC systems for the same targeted DP.149 3.6. R-and Z-group hydrophobicity In conventional emulsion polymerizations with an aqueous phase initiator, initiator derived radicals located in the aqueous phase undergo propagation with aqueous phase monomer to generate oligomeric radicals.22 If the concentration of surfac-tants is below the CMC, these radicals will propagate until they either terminate or reach a critical degree of polymerization ( jcrit), upon which they become insoluble in water. Once jcrit has been reached, the radicals will precipitate to form a primary particle.150–152 The primary particles formed will undergo limited coagulation with other primary particles until a more colloidally stable particle is formed from the ever-increasing surface charge. At this point, the particle can absorb an appreciable amount of monomer.22 For concentrations of sur-factants above the CMC, or once the particle formation is complete, the accepted mechanism by which radicals enter particles is that which was developed by Maxwell et al.153 The oligomeric radicals propagate until the number of monomer units reaches a critical length (z-mer); these z-mers are then Review Article Chem Soc Rev Pu bl is he d on  24 A pr il 20 23 .

Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023able to enter into the particles or monomer-swollen micelles. In conventional emulsion polymerization systems, these entered radicals can propagate with monomers within the particle, terminate with another radical or exit the particle. Radical exit can only occur after a chain transfer to monomer event, in which a monomeric radical is generated with suffi-cient water solubility to exit the particle.22 In macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymerization, the entered radical can also interact with the RAFT moiety. During the pre-equilibrium stage of the RAFT polymerization, as the R-group fragments and forms a radical, if the radical does not have sufficient hydrophobicity, it can undergo exit from the particle. The exit of the R-group has been shown to be a kinetically significant event.154,155 Huang et al.134 showed that in the RAFT emulsion polymerization of styrene, the expelled PAA macroradical can exit the particle (Scheme 5A), leading to a long induction period. Numerous studies have demon-strated R-group induced exit when employing low MW RAFT agents.154,156,157 Minimizing R-group exit means employing an R-group such that the generated macroradical during the RAFT pre-equilibrium is sufficiently hydrophobic that exit does not occur. Examples include using PMAA130,131 over PAA as the hydrophilic section or adding a small hydrophobic block to the R-group of PAA121,134 macroRAFT systems. Recently, Guimarães et al.131 demonstrated that RAFT agents can suffer from the so-called Z-group induced RAFT exit in macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymerizations. PMAA-based macroRAFT agents with varying hydrophobicity of Z-groups were employed in the RAFT PISA emulsion polymer-ization of styrene. When RAFT agents containing butyl and dodecyl Z-groups were used, the polymerization reached full conversion within 2 h with low dispersities (Ð o 1.30). When the more hydrophilic propionic acid Z-group was employed, a low polymerization rate was observed, only reaching 53% conversion after 6 h and exhibiting poor RAFT control. This difference is attributed to the Z-group induced exit. During the RAFT pre-equilibrium, the initiator derived radical reacts with the macroRAFT agent to form an R-group macroradical and a This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3451Z-group RAFT species containing the RAFT moiety and the short initiator derived moiety. The propionic acid Z-group is sufficiently hydrophilic for the Z-group RAFT species to undergo exit from the particle. This results in the loss of the RAFT moiety from the hydrophobic domain (Scheme 5B). As a consequence, particle aggregation occurs due to fewer amphi-philic chains and the extent of swelling with styrene is lowered due to the reduced rate of chain extension. Both these factors contribute to a reduction in the polymerization rate. To avoid the Z-group induced exit, the Z-group on the RAFT agent must have sufficient hydrophobicity such that the exit of the formed Z-group RAFT species is energetically unfavourable. The most commonly employed examples are trithiocarbonates containing a long alkyl chain Z-group.130,131 4. Sequential seeded emulsion polymerization for multiblock synthesis Seeded emulsion polymerization is similar to ab initio emulsion polymerization, with the exception of the presence of a colloid-ally stable seed latex whose particles become the locus of polymerization instead of micelles/aggregates. Subsequently, seeded emulsion polymerizations forgo the nucleation step characteristic of their ab initio counterpart.22 Rather, polymer-ization commences at either Interval II or III depending on the monomer concentration, with no new particles being formed if the seed particles are sufficiently able to capture oligomeric radical species.158 As such, seeded emulsion polymerizations have relatively good batch reproducibility and control over the particle size and rate, also providing a greater degree of control over morphology, e.g. core–shell, hemispherical particles, etc.159,160 In terms of RAFT, seeded emulsion polymerization was initially used to mitigate issues with RAFT agent transport to the locus of polymerization and diminish complexities associated with nucleation.161,162 Previous studies used acetone to transport the RAFT agent to the seed prior to polymerization; issues with inhibition, retardation, control and colloidal stabi-lity were however prevalent.84,102,156,163 Results improved when the RAFT agent was exclusively located within the particles.161 To this end, as alluded to in Section 3, the use of an amphi-philic block copolymer comprising both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments chain extended from the RAFT agent, self-assembling into micelles as the locus of polymerization, has proved advantageous in both mitigating these issues and removing the need for conventional surfactants.101,102,164 This, in combination with the rate increasing influence of the segregation effect has improved the versatility of the strategy, leading to a diverse and growing array of multiblock copoly-mers able to be synthesized. Seeded emulsion polymerization can also be employed for the preparation of complex macromolecular architectures such as multiblock copolymers. The breakthrough work by Moad and coworkers on rapid, high conversion multiblock synthesis via sulfur-free RAFT emulsion polymerization in a semi-continuous process demonstrated promising results in the synthesis of a well controlled heptablock copolymer (Fig. 7A).48 Haddleton and coworkers further extended this strategy to the successful pre-paration of a wide range of precise, high-order, multiblock copolymers comprising various methacrylates. An undecablock (11 blocks comprising four different methacrylates) was success-fully prepared as demonstrated by the clear shift of SEC traces towards high molecular weight after each polymerization cycle.165 This method is very robust and adaptable to a wide range of methacrylates, and can be easily scaled up due to the industrial relevance of emulsion polymerization. Armes and coworkers demonstrated the robustness of PISA in the emulsion polymerization of tetrablock copolymers com-prising alternating poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) and PBMA blocks, chain extended from a hydrophilic PMAA macro-RAFT via sequential addition (PMAA56-b-PBMA500-b-PBzMA500-b-PBMA500 and PMAA56-b-PBzMA500-b-PBMA500-b-PBzMA500). 167 These syntheses were conducted in an automated workflow robot (Chemspeed Autoplant A100, Fig. 8A) – five repetitions of both PMAA56-b-PBMA500 and PMAA56-b-PBzMA500 diblocks in the robot gave a high degree of consistency in terms of the MWD, conversion, and particle diameter between polymeriza-tions. Subsequently, high-throughput syntheses of the tetra-blocks to high molecular weights (B130 000 g molNone1) conducted in the Chemspeed A100 begat broad yet unimodal MWDs (1.5 o Ð o 1.9, Fig. 8B and C). Multiblock copolymer synthesis is often a laborious task in terms of weighing reac-tants, block addition, and sampling that only becomes more arduous as the number of blocks increases. Automation of the polymerization process presents promising possibilities in terms of both the synthesis of multiblock copolymers too impractical to conduct on a laboratory scale and high-throughput synthesis that would otherwise have been per-formed one by one. Thompson et al. further explored the utility of PISA through the polymerization of a PSt seed from which an alternating PBMA and PSt hexablock copolymer was synthesized.149 Clear MWD shifting and dispersities below 1.5 were obtained (Fig. 8D); in both PISA studies, high solids contents (SC 4 30%) were additionally accessed. Recently, Guerrero-Santos’s group developed a technique for the incorporation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic mono-mers in a multiblock copolymer in a dispersed system.168 This work was based on their previous use of dialkoxyamine trithio-carbonate as a dual initiator-transfer agent,169 with NMP and RAFT polymerizations occurring in tandem. In their more recent work, this same RAFT/NMP CTA was first chain extended with acrylic acid (AA), upon which it was further sequentially chain extended in dispersion with polystyrene (PAA-b-PSt-b-PAA) via PISA. Following this, 4-styrene sulfonate (SSNa) was used to chain extend from the hydrophilic PAA arms of the previous triblock at the particle surface via surface initiated NMP (PSSNa-b-PAA-b-PSt-b-PAA-b-PSSNa).168 The RAFT moiety, being confined to the particle core, is at this point inaccessible to the water soluble SSNa. This represents a significant step in multiblock synthesis, especially since non-macroRAFT multiblock copolymers comprising both hydrophobic and Review Article Chem Soc Rev Pu bl is he d on  24 A pr il 20 23 .

These researchers have also synthesized heptablock copoly-mers with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks in solution via RAFT with relatively low dispersities (Ð o 1.6).170 On the topic of surface functionalization, conducting RAFT polymerization in heterogeneous systems using Z-type macro-RAFTs (the solvophilic block is covalently bonded to the Z-group instead of the R-group as is more commonly seen) is another potential avenue for multiblock synthesis.171 Additional advantages include easier surface functionalization and removal of both the RAFT moiety and the solvophilic block, if desired.172,173 It thus may be of interest to use such macro-RAFTs for the synthesis of multiblock copolymers; block copo-lymers have already been synthesized via PISA and dispersion polymerization in this manner.171–174 While previous systems exhibit relatively low molecular weights for multiblock copolymers, Clothier et al. demon-strated that through prudent control over experimental para-meters in conjunction with a judicious choice of the colloidal stabilizing macroRAFT, high molecular weight multiblock copolymers can be synthesized with low reaction times (30 min per block), low dispersities, and high conversions.40 This was achieved even for low kp monomers (methacrylates), courtesy of the compartmentalization effect in emulsion polymerization. An amphiphilic macroRAFT synthesized via solution polymerization was used in the polymerization of a PBMA seed latex, whose particles would act as nanoreactors for subsequent sequential seeded emulsion polymerizations of multiblock copolymers. Using this strategy, PBMA deca-block homopolymers and a multicompositional heptablock (PBMA275-b-PBzMA100-b-PtBMA100-b-PiBMA100-b-PHMA100-b-PEMA100-b-PMMA100) comprising seven different sequentially added methacrylate blocks were synthesized to high conver-sion, high molecular weights (4100 000 g molNone1), and precisely tailored compositions. In a similar manner, a methacrylate heptablock (PBMA100-b-PHMA20-b-PBMA20-b-PHMA20-b-PBMA20-b-PHMA20-b-PBMA20) comprising alternating blocks of BMA and HMA was synthesized in a later study by Richardson et al via sequential monomer addition to demonstrate the robustness of systems exploiting the in-built feed mechanism characteristic of emulsion polymerizations.41 Multiblock copolymers exhibiting multilayered morphology with PSt and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) alternating blocks (PSt200-b-P(BA175-co-St25)-b-PSt200-b-P(BA175-co-St25)-b-PSt200) were also reported by Guimaraes et al. 109 This work was later expanded upon with the synthesis of multilayered particles comprising styrene and a variety of methacrylate This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem.

There is growing interest surrounding the mechanical properties multiblock copolymers can afford in comparison to diblocks and triblocks, random copolymers, and homo-polymers.175–177 In 2016 Lei and coworkers synthesized penta-block copolymers comprising PSt and PBA via dropwise sequen-tial monomer addition using a symmetrical RAFT agent.178 Though dispersities were high (Ð 4 2), promising results regarding the mechanical properties of multiblock copolymers were observed, namely improved torque values and impact strength compared to equivalent random copolymers, support-ing similar results gained from triblock analyses. This was subsequently expanded on with the synthesis of an octablock via macroRAFT mediated sequential emulsion polymerization, also comprising alternating PSt and PBA blocks (PSt176-PBA286)4. 144 Molecular weights were high (4100 000 g molNone1) though relatively high dispersities were achieved (Ð = 1.8 for the final block). Tensile properties were demonstrated to signifi-cantly improve with an increasing number of blocks, a promis-ing result for broadening the avenues of applications for multiblock copolymers. Further studies by the group focussing on ‘hard–soft–hard’ multiblock copolymers once again com-prising PSt and PBA confirmed the superior tensile strength and toughness of (PStm-b-PBAn-b-PStm)2 compared to those of both PStm-b-PBAn-b-PStm and PSt2m-b-PBA2n-b-PSt2m, demon-strating the importance of both the molecular weight and numbers of blocks in terms of mechanical properties.143 Phase separation and high PBA content were also associated with better mechanical properties. Applications in robotics are already being explored, with the microphase separation of PSt-b-PBA-b-PSt allowing for a low Tg while maintaining struc-tural integrity compared to alternative materials, in the con-struction of ‘wings’ for a deep-sea exploratory soft robot.179 Recently, Okamura’s group in collaboration with Zetterlund and coworkers through the synthesis and analysis of di-, tetra-and octablock copolymers comprising alternating PBMA and PSt blocks (PBMA400-b-PSt400, (PBMA200-b-PSt200)2, and (PBMA100-b-PSt100)4 respectively) shed light on how varying the number of blocks in equivalent molecular weight multiblock copolymers affects their efficacy as compatibilizers between polymer blend films.166 For this system, multiblock copolymers were demon-strated to reduce the phase separation domain size compared to the corresponding diblock copolymer. Similar observations were detected by Dadmun and coworkers;180 a series of multiblocks comprising alternating PSt and PMMA blocks (diblocks, triblocks, pentablocks, and heptablocks) used to compatibilize PSt/PMMA interfaces saw stronger interfaces with an increasing number of blocks.181 It was observed however that the trend stopped at the heptablock, which showed comparatively poorer compatibiliza-tion; this was attributed to the low block molecular weight, once 3454 | Chem.

There are a number of techniques involving RAFT with a significant room for development, especially in the realm of multiblock copolymer synthesis.182,183 Alternatives to thermal initiation have been receiving special attention given the pos-sibility of conducting polymerizations under mild to ambient conditions, granting of spatial and temporal control, the sup-pression of undesirable initiator-derived by-products, and a movement towards more environmentally friendly, less energy intensive and sustainable polymerizations.183–187 Since the seminal works by Boyer in 2014,185,186 PET–RAFT has proven to be a promising technique in multiblock copolymer syn-thesis;188,189 photo-iniferter RAFT, whereby the RAFT agent is activated directly by irradiation as opposed to via photocatalyst, has also shown promise in this area.190–192 However, applica-tions in dispersed systems remain rare and unoptimized due to their opacity and the necessity of light penetration.193,194 The generation of radicals via biocatalysis offers a sustainable and efficient approach to polymerization initiation.195 While the technique has been applied to both conventional radical polymerization196 and RDRP197,198 for some time, it was only in 2015 when An and coworkers applied biocatalysis by the established horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/H2O2/acetylacetone (ACAC) system to RAFT polymerization, demonstrating good control of a number of monomers under both homogenous and heterogenous conditions.187 A similar system was used for the synthesis of four decablock copolymers via aqueous solution polymerization comprising either one or both of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) and poly(4-acryloylmorpholine) (PAML) through the sequential addition of monomers and constituents of the HRP/H2O2/ACAC system (PDMA150–(PAML50– PDMA50)4–PAML50 and PDMA100–(PAML50–PAML50–PDMA50)3). 199 Dispersities ranged from 1.4 to 1.5; although the polymerization was conducted in a homogenous system, enzyme-catalyzed poly-merizations in emulsion mediated by both SARA-ATRP (SET-LRP) for the synthesis of diblocks comprising PBMA and PMMA200 and RAFT polymerization for the synthesis of various triblocks201 suggest the transition into multiblock synthesis via RAFT in emulsion would be feasible. Similarly, redox initiated RAFT has instances of multiblock copolymer synthesis in the literature,202,203 while the emulsion polymerization of styrene has been conducted via electrochemically initiated RAFT (eRAFT).204 This led to the successful seeded emulsion poly-merization of PBMA200–PSt100–PMS100 (PMS = p-methylstyrene) triblock and PBMA200–PSt100–PBA100–PSt100 tetrablock copoly-mers to low dispersities (Ð = 1.24 and Ð = 1.16 respectively).205 Conducting the polymerization via seeded emulsion gave the advantage of segregating the RAFT moiety from the working electrode, given that contact between them has been demon-strated to result in the irreversible consumption of the RAFT agent and passivation of the electrode.205–207 Finally, the combination of step-growth (SG) and RAFT polymerization is an innovative strategy to synthesize complex macromolecular structures. The successful combination of Diels–Alder step-growth and RAFT polymerization was recently employed for the preparation of multi-segmented macromolecules.208,209 Polymer chains were equipped with several RAFT agents dis-tributed along the backbone of the chains. This elegant strategy could potentially be explored for the generation of high-order multiblock copolymers (420 blocks) via few (1–2) chain extension reactions from the mid-chain RAFT moieties – significantly redu-cing the number of polymerization cycles. Exploration of the synthesis of multiblock copolymers in these unique systems is expected to be relatively easy to adapt to heterogeneous conditions and a worthwhile endeavour for future studies. 4.1. Order of monomer addition The synthesis of di-or multi-block copolymers via sequential RAFT polymerization encounters an intrinsic limitation regard-ing the order of monomer addition.74,84,210–212 The typical preparation of an AB block copolymer involves RAFT polymer-ization of monomer A, followed by chain extension with mono-mer B, resulting in the AB diblock copolymer. However, according to the RAFT mechanism (Scheme 1), the propagating radical generated from the first monomer (A) must present a better leaving group than the propagating species from mono-mer B to result in ‘‘forward’’ fragmentation and, consequently, successful block formation. Otherwise, ‘‘backward’’ fragmenta-tion can occur leading to the homopolymerization of monomer B instead of the desired chain extension. A classic example of this limitation is the synthesis of block copolymers comprising methacrylate-and styrene-based monomers. The chain extension of a methacrylate macroRAFT with styrene can be successfully conducted leading to a well-defined diblock copolymer. On the other hand, the poor chain extension of a styrene-based macro-RAFT with methacrylate monomers is usually observed.212 This limitation regarding the order of polymerization obviously repre-sents a serious impediment on the preparation of high-ordered multiblock copolymers via sequential RAFT polymerizations. The use of a comonomer during RAFT polymerization of the second block can be implemented to assist in the successful preparation of the di-or multiblock copolymer in the wrong order of monomer addition.109,110,119,166,213 This strategy is based on the use of a low content of comonomer (o10 wt%) which will lead to the reduction of Ctr during chain extension. The principle behind this concept is presumably the formation of macroradical adducts with a terminal comonomer unit comprising a better leaving group (mkb, Scheme 1). 212,214 This strategy was built on previous works reported by Charleux and coworkers130,213,215–217 on the successfully controlled polymer-ization of methacrylates via nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP). For most applications, such low contents of comono-mers (o10 wt%) would not significantly affect the properties of the block copolymers such as Tg, polarity, mechanical proper-ties, etc. Conducting RAFT polymerization via emulsion polymeriza-tion in a semi-continuous process has also been proposed to circumvent the issue of the monomer addition order. As pre-sented in Section 3.4, the idea of this concept is based on the reduction of the monomer concentration at the polymerization locus, allowing for the addition of fewer monomer units after Chem Soc Rev Review Article Pu bl is he d on  24 A pr il 20 23 .

Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3455each cycle of addition/fragmentation during the RAFT process. Inspired by this concept, Moad and coworkers49,84,120 reported in the early 2000’s an elegant strategy on the preparation of multiblock copolymers via ‘‘sulfur free RAFT’’ emulsion poly-merization. This strategy consists of the preparation of an macromonomer end-functionalized with methacrylate groups (block A) which can be further reactivated for the polymeriza-tion of monomer B, generating the AB block copolymer. Main-taining very low concentrations of monomer B through the use of a starved monomer feed has the consequence that when the undesirable ‘‘backward’’ fragmentation occurs, there is less ‘‘punishment’’ in the sense that fewer B units are added than would otherwise be the case. Eventually, ‘‘forward’’ fragmentation occurs, and the chain extension of Block A with B is then achieved. This can be accomplished by conducting the polymer-ization as a semi-continuous process where the feeding rate of the monomer can be adjusted to minimize its accumulation in the system – i.e. the feeding rate is similar to the rate of monomer consumption, resulting in starve-fed conditions. Hence, a well-defined methacrylate-based heptablock multiblock copolymer (Fig. 7A) was successfully synthesized in a one-pot process. Recently, Engelis et al.87,165 further expanded this concept through investigating the preparation of methacrylate-based multiblock copolymers via ‘‘sulfur-free RAFT’’ emulsion poly-merization in starved-fed conditions. Sophisticated high-order multiblock copolymers (up to 21 blocks) were obtained using a one-pot process, with full conversions after each polymeri-zation cycle (498%) resulting in low dispersity polymers (Ð = 1.20–1.35). An undecablock multiblock copolymer using four dif-ferent methacrylates, altering the monomer sequence and compo-sition, was successfully prepared as indicated by the clear MWD shift towards a higher MW after each polymerization cycle (Fig. 7D). Although excellent control over the architecture, the molecular weight and composition were obtained in these systems, and the lack of versatility is an intrinsic limitation of the method given that the process is restricted to methacrylates. Based on these two concepts: (i) use of comonomers and (ii) low monomer concentrations at the polymerization locus, a detailed investigation was carried out regarding the use of comonomers on the synthesis of multiblocks via RAFT emul-sion polymerization. Multiblock copolymers comprising alter-nating PBMA and PSt blocks were synthesized in a comparative study either in the presence or the absence of comonomers (10 wt% St) via solution, miniemulsion and emulsion polymer-ization (Fig. 9).119 As expected, the successful chain extension of PBMA with St was obtained during the synthesis of a 3456 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023PBMA200-b-PSt200-PBMA180-stat-PSt20 triblock copolymer (shift of MWDs from the 1st block to the 2nd block, Fig. 9C and D) – given that methacryloyl radicals are better leaving radicals than styrene-based ones.212 However, for the next block extension with BMA (3rd block, Fig. 9C and D), the addition of St as a comonomer was crucial in the successful formation of the well-defined triblock copolymer. A PBMA200-b-PMMA100-b-PSt100-b-(PMMA90-stat-PSt10)-b-PSt100 pentablock was then synthesized to solidify the concept. It is worth noting that the addition of the comonomer could not solely circumvent the limitation of the monomer addition order in solution and miniemulsion (Fig. 9B, D and F), demonstrating that the in-built monomer feed mecha-nism in emulsion polymerization (i.e. the monomer diffusing from monomer droplets to polymer particles) also played a crucial role in the successful formation of a well-defined multiblock copolymer regardless of the monomer order.41,119 In conclusion, the synergis-tic effect of the use of the comonomer alongside conducting RAFT in emulsion polymerization has proved to be a successful strategy for the preparation of high-order multiblock copolymers, and has since been further employed successfully in various systems (Fig. 7B, C, D, E, F and 9D).109,110,166 4.2. Radical penetration As the complexity and scope of multiblock copolymers able to be synthesized increases, new challenges arise. The synthesis of well controlled, high molecular weight multiblock copolymers is relatively new to RAFT, though a necessary endeavor for many practical applications, especially when considering phase separation and mechanical properties.144,218 As previously mentioned, the compartmentalization effect characteristic of emulsion polymerization has allowed a process traditionally more suited for the synthesis of oligomers to achieve the synthesis of multiblock copolymers with high molecular weights (4100 000 g molNone1).40 As the polymer molecular weight and thus particle size increases in emulsion polymerization systems, the rate of radical diffusion through particles becomes a significant point of concern.142 In systems where the RAFT agent Z-group is located towards the particle core, such as where a stabilizing macroRAFT is involved, radical oligomers generated in the continuous phase (z-mers) should ideally penetrate and subsequently diffuse swiftly through polymer particles to avoid termination events and to ensure that not too many monomer additions occur before the RAFT chain transfer step.142 However, there are a number of factors that significantly affect the rate of radical diffusion, including but not limited to Tg of the seed and subsequent polymer blocks, the extent of monomer swelling of particles, polymerization temperature, crosslinking, and monomer conversion; such factors can be generalized to the ‘hardness’ of a given polymer particle.142,158,219–222 It has been demonstrated by Sundberg and coworkers that frustrated radical diffusion in non-living seeded emulsion polymerizations begets particle morphologies tending towards core–shell, as propagating chains experience termination events throughout the particle surface region.223 In the corresponding RAFT systems, such terminated polymer is not under RAFT control, with chain extension subsequently ceasing and ever broader dispersities becoming apparent.142 The exact morphology produced in a seeded emulsion system can be more precisely determined by considering a number of factors including Tg, the extent of phase separation, interfacial tension at the particle/water interface, etc.158,224 Polymer particles containing high Tg polymers such as poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) PtBMA and PSt reduce chain mobi-lity and are thus expected to be particularly susceptible to issues with radical penetration. This was supported by the recent work on the synthesis of undecablock model homopo-lymers (i.e. successive blocks of the same monomer) using PBMA, poly(iso-butyl methacrylate) (PiBMA) and PtBMA (Tg = 20 1C, 57 1C and 118 1C respectively), where a trend linking higher Tg to higher dispersity was observed (Fig. 10). 142 The Tg of PtBMA is above the polymerization temperature (80 1C); the high dispersities and broad MWDs seen in Fig. 10C can thus be attributed to the failure of propagating radicals to penetrate through to the RAFT moiety before undergoing uncontrolled polymerization at various depths and on the surface of the polymer particles, as well as too many monomer units being added prior to propagating radicals undergoing RAFT exchange. MWD broadening and higher dispersities were still observed in the PiBMA system (Fig. 10B) compared to the lower Tg PBMA (Fig. 10A), implying that high MW polymers with Tg values below the polymerization temperature can still be affected by radical penetration. Lower MW polymers (%xn o 100) generally avoid such issues entirely, even when the poly-mer Tg exceeds the polymerization temperature. 158,222 Artificial plasticization of particles, whether by a monomer or a swelling agent such as toluene, has been demonstrated to enhance the radical penetration of high Tg polymers and thus beget narrower MWDs.142,144,223 However, high dispersity values are still observed in these cases. 4.3. Nature of the initiator The use of oil-soluble initiators has been proposed as a method of overcoming issues with radical penetration. Indeed, it was demonstrated by Zetterlund’s group that for the seeded emulsion polymerization of high Tg PtBMA undecablock copolymers, using initiators of increasing hydrophobicity (potassium persulfate (KPS) o 4,40-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid) (ACPA) o azobisiso-butyronitrile (AIBN) o benzoyl peroxide (BPO) with water solubi-lities of 52, 2.75, 0.35 and 9.10 None 10None3 g LNone1 respectively) resulted in multiblock copolymers with narrower MWDs, clearer block shifting and a decreasing prevalence of high MW shoulders (Fig. 11).225 The effect was significantly reduced yet still noticeable for equivalent polymerizations using the lower Tg PBMA. While the initiation mechanism of water-soluble initiators in emulsion has been studied extensively and is well understood,22,158 there remains a degree of obscurity around the exact mechanisms regarding oil-soluble initiators in equivalent systems.226 This is perhaps a contributing factor to its state as a rarity for use in emulsion and seeded emulsion polymerization systems, with limited applications being seen in reducing homogenous nucleation,227–230 improving colloidal stability,231,232 and achiev-ing particular morphologies.233,234 Chem Soc Rev Review Article Pu bl is he d on  24 A pr il 20 23 .

Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3457Two main schools of thought regarding the exact nature of oil-soluble initiation in emulsion have been proposed, with differences concerning whether single radicals are sourced from the (i) aqueous phase235–238 or (ii) oil phase.227,239–241 Proposal (i) considers a strict application of Smith–Ewart 0–1 kinetics, with the result being an annihilation of geminate oil-phase radical pairs via bimolecular termination; instead, trace concentrations of oil-soluble initiators in the aqueous phase contribute to initiation through a similar mechanism to water-soluble initiators. Proposal (ii) suggests that the radical exit from particles is competitive with bimolecular termination, with a single radical being left behind and the exiting radical free to terminate or re-enter an alternate particle. It has also been suggested specifically for RAFT mediated systems that radical activity can be transferred to a dormant chain, increas-ing the instance of two radicals inhabiting a single particle.242 The significant difference between the MWDs of KPS and BPO initiated systems highlights the clear role of the mitigation of radical penetration and lends credence to proposal (ii); oil-sourced radicals forgo the need to penetrate the water/particle interface and require a lesser diffusion distance to encounter the RAFT moiety. It should however also be noted that the use of more hydrophobic initiators also resulted in decreased reaction rates. This was attributed to the cage effect; given the oil-soluble initiator is situated within polymer particles, upon decomposition there is a very real possibility that bimo-lecular termination occurs as per Smith–Ewart’s 0–1 kinetics, highlighted in proposal (i).243 While somewhat allayed both by processes leading to the radical exit244 and transferal of radical activity to dormant chains as per the RAFT mechanism,242 the contribution of the cage effect remains a significant factor, especially when polymerizing low kp monomers. Higher initia-tor concentrations may thus be necessary to overcome this effect. 5. Morphology 5.1. Microphase separation of block copolymers One of the most intriguing properties of multiblock copolymers obtained in dispersed media is their microphase separation within the particles. The microphase separation of block copo-lymers in bulk is a well-established field which has attracted significant interest in a wide variety of spheres, including nanotechnology, microelectronics, and nanofabrication. Most applications to date focus on thin films of diblock copolymers to produce patterned surfaces as templates for nanofabrication applications, including nanoporous films, lithographic masks, photonic materials, nanoparticle production and high-density magnetic devices.245–247 Such a wide range of applications arises from the versatility of the polymer design in terms of size, structure, composition, and the variety of ordered nano-domains obtained by self-assembly. The emergence of novel economical and simple synthetic routes for the synthesis of block copolymers has also precipitated the development of applications through the production of extensive arrays of 3458 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023materials exhibiting superior mechanical properties when com-pared to the existing polymeric materials. If the blocks of a block copolymer are incompatible, spon-taneous self-assembly occurs in nanodomains. Annealing of the resulting materials, typically using temperature or solvent vapours, leads to ordered microphase morphologies, whose size can range from tens to hundreds of nanometers. The morphologies are typically governed by both the enthalpic gain of demixing of the constituent blocks and the entropic cost of chain confinement within the domains. The microphase mor-phology is determined by the constituent block volume fraction (f), alongside both the overall degree of polymerization (N), and the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (w), which when combined, make up the degree of incompatibility (wN). For instance, in the simple example of an AB diblock copolymer, wAB is a dimensionless interaction parameter, which expresses the energy change when one takes a molecule of pure A from an environment of pure A and puts it in an environment of pure B. wAB can be calculated from the expression (eqn (3)): 248 wAB ¼ ðuAuBÞ RT 1=2 ðdA None dBÞ2 (3) where dA and dB represent molar volumes of polymers A and B, respectively, dA and dB are the solubility parameters of A and B, respectively, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Under the condition wN r 10.5, the system is governed by entropic terms, leading to a disordered phase. In the case wN 4 10.5, enthalpic terms dominate, resulting in an order– disordered transition (ODT), where A and B blocks phase separate into the ordered microstructures.218,249 For incompa-tible AB diblock copolymers, an evolution of the microphase separation morphology can be observed, namely a progression This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3459of lamellae (volume fraction fA E 0.35–0.69) to hexagonally packed cylinders of B in a matrix of A ( fA E 0.10 None 0.35 and 0.69 None 0.90), to spheres of B in a matrix of A ( fA r 0.1 and Z 0.90), see Fig. 12.218 It should be noted that the phase diagram boundaries become significantly less well defined at lower wN values. More complicated nanostructures, such as perforated lamellae and gyroid structures, although suggested as meta-stable, are also accessible on the condition that the composi-tion of the copolymer lies between lamellar and cylindrical morphologies within a narrow range. The number and types of morphologies also increase signifi-cantly when additional blocks are added in multiblock copolymers.1 The microphase behaviour of triblock copolymers displays an additional layer of complexity when compared to diblock copolymers, and is determined by the individual block weight fraction (fA + fB + fC = 1), the total degree of polymerization (NABC), and also the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters between each segment, i.e. wAB, wBC and wAC. Structural factors including polymer chain topology and the sequence of component blocks (ABC, ACB, CBA, and CAB) also have a significant influence over microphase separation. This leads to a wider range of acces-sible morphologies, including but not limited to lamella–lamellae, lamella–cylinders, lamella–spheres, cylinders–in-lamellae, core/ shell cylinders, triple/quadruple cylinder-on-cylinders, perforated circular lamella-on-cylinders, double/triple helices-on-cylinders, knitting pattern, core/shell double gyroid, etc.251 For instance, Fig. 13 illustrates the range of morphologies expected from the triblock copolymer PSt-b-PBd-b-PtBMA (Bd = butadiene).252 Increasing the number of blocks further affects relevant parameters, leading to a wide spectrum of factors to consider. The effect of block dispersity for instance becomes a complex parameter to predict, making modelling and therefore mor-phology prediction very difficult, only possible through gui-dance from the characterisation of pre-synthesised structures. Advanced characterisation techniques thus become key players in the design process of materials based on microphase separa-tion. How various parameters influence each other should also be taken into consideration. Increasing the number of blocks whilst reducing their degree of polymerization in systems that would typically show microphase separation, e.g. polystyrene/ polyisoprene multiblock copolymers253 or poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate)/poly(tert-butyl acrylate),254 leads to a system which behaves more like a statistical copolymer (no phase separation) than a block copolymer. The role of the interface between the polymeric material and the outer system – highly relevant to emulsion polymerization since the interface is always with a non-solvent, typically water – can also affect morphology. Such phenomena have been mostly 3460 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023studied in the case of thin films of block copolymers, where each constituent block’s wetting properties at both the surface of the substrate and the air/film interface affect microphase separation.246,255 For instance, for copolymers forming lamel-lae morpohologies parallel to the substrate, a multi-layered structure is generated, with the thickness of the film being a multiple of the lamellar period, L0. In the case of symmetric wetting, where the blocks have an affinity to both the air and substrate interfaces, the resultant film is continuous and smooth given its thickness is t = nL0, with n being an integer (Fig. 14A). However, in the case of asymmetric wetting, where one block has more affinity for the substrate and the other block for the air interface, a smooth film can only be obtained for the film thickness t = (n + 1/2) L0 (Fig. 14B). In cases where the prepared film has a thickness that is not a multiple of L0, the formation of holes or islands with a height L0 becomes apparent (Fig. 14C). The hole/island morphology has been examined in a number of systems, including those forming lamellar domains, and also for cylinder-forming256,257 and sphere-forming systems.258,259 To date, most studies of block copolymer self-assembly have focused on systems where blocks are both segregated to a significant extent owing to their distinct chemical structures, and monodisperse in the chain length, to ensure a high degree of ordering.260 However more recently, experiments261,262 and theoretical studies260 have demonstrated that well-ordered This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3461morphologies may also be accessed in block copolymer systems obtained with (narrow) polydispersity by more versatile syn-thetic techniques such as radical-based polymerisations (e.g. RAFT polymerisation). These observations have opened the path to a wider range of applications, since these synthetic techniques are more scaleable and more versatile for the manufacturing industry. A notable example is the work by Luo and coworkers, who utilised seeded RAFT emulsion polymerization to synthesise high molecular weight octablock copolymers.263 High degrees of polymerization (4100) were targeted to observe microphase separation between low w systems such as PSt-b-PBA. During styrene chain extensions, a small percentage of toluene (8 wt% to styrene) was introduced to act as a plasticizer to improve the monomer conversion (from 96 to over 98%). This ensured efficient chain extension at each stage of the ‘one-pot’ octablock (8 blocks) synthesis. Following solvent casting (which of course destroys any morphology of the original latex nanoparticles), the resulting multiblock copolymer films showed clear micro-phase separation behaviour as lamellar morphologies (with periods around 40–50 nm) observed via AFM, even for multi-blocks with low w values such as (PSt-b-PBA)m with m = 1–4. Moreover, the number of blocks was shown to affect thermal and mechanical properties – the increasing block number led to both an increase in the glass transition temperature and tensile strength. Further studies by Luo and coworkers explored in detail the effect of the block architecture on the mechanical properties of the respective multiblocks. A systematic library of hard (PSt domains) and soft (PBA domains) multiblock copolymers was synthesised.148 Interestingly, an increase in the block number led to an enhancement in the tensile strength and toughness of the material, but no significant changes to the modulus were observed. This combination of soft, strong and tough elasto-meric behaviour has great potential applications in soft robotics and wearable/stretchable electronics. 5.2. Particle morphology (multi-layered particles) In the field of nanoparticles, the self-assembly of block copo-lymers has led to a plethora of novel morphologies.106,110,264–270 The ability to tailor nanoparticle morphology comes from an understanding of how polymers interact with one another and their solvent environment. In solution, the nanoparticle for-mation of block copolymers occurs spontaneously when one block is solvophobic and another is solvophilic. The simplest example is the assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers. In the presence of water, such polymer phase separates to form a hydrophobic core and highly solvated hydrophilic corona. The block copolymer phase behaviour is influenced by the compo-sition, confinement, surface area and solvent exposure (i.e., the interfacial free energy), all of which alter the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviours of the self-assembled system, and in turn dictate the nanoparticle morphology.271–273 Moreover, the extensive literature on polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA)106,274,275 highlights the ease with which a range of higher-order morphologies can be accessed.276 It is also worth noting the importance of understanding key parameters during polymerization (i.e., the choice of macroCTA, monomer, temperature, concentration, etc.) that affect the resulting morphology.106,274 The self-assembly of diblock copolymers, which has been widely examined, will not be covered in this review.104,131,277,278 Importantly, when moving from diblock to multiblock copolymer assemblies in solution, the mixing and phase separation behaviour increases in complexity.11 The phase separation of multiblock copolymers has been a key for realising increasingly complex morphologies such as multi-layered nanoparticles. An early example by Wooley and coworkers used triblock copolymers to yield multi-layered particles that could form kinetically trapped or covalently crosslinked toroidal (or ring-like) assemblies.279 Groschel et al. reported the precise hierarchical self-assembly of micelles made up of multiple compartments using linear ABC triblock terpolymers.280 Importantly, all these systems are assembled using a solvent exchange process. The polymer is first fully dissolved (all blocks solvated), followed by self-assembly trig-gered by the slow addition of a non-solvent (a solvent whereby the polymer or, in this case a certain ‘block’, is solvophobic). Connal et al. reported that such a solvent assembly process could also be combined with metal coordination to yield hybrid mesostructured block copolymer nanoparticles.281 This was achieved using a solvent exchange strategy referred to as the solvent-absorbing/releasing method (SARM).269,282 Howdle and coworkers reported the use of RAFT dispersion polymerization to generate triblock copolymers (PMMA-b-PSt-b-P4VP) in supercritical CO2. 283 TEM images revealed that PMMA-b-PSt diblock copolymers could adopt a lamellar morphology, 3462 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023and that the addition of the P4VP block could lead to the formation of distinct spherical domains in the lamellar sheets through microparticle confinement. This morphology is less pronounced at the particle core due to the increased spherical constraint at the centre of these microstructures. These micro-domains formed within the particle were then used as a template to form hollow TiO2 microparticles. RAFT emulsion polymerization has been used to nano-engineer multiblock copolymer particles. Guimaraes et al. reported using macroRAFT-assisted emulsion polymerization to yield high-order multi-layered nanoparticles.109 The amphiphilic diblock copolymer poly(acrylic acid)-b-polystyrene (PAA24-b-PSt8-TTC) was first synthe-sised and then used to prepare polystyrene seed particles via ab initio emulsion polymerization as outlined in Section 4. Subse-quently, sequential seeded emulsion polymerizations were per-formed to generate a pentablock copolymer comprising alter-nating blocks of polystyrene and poly(butyl methacrylate). Ultrathin cross-sectional TEM imaging of the nanoparticles immobilised in epoxy resin revealed the expected multi-layered ‘onion-like’ particle morphologies (Fig. 15). Following this work, Khan et al. further demonstrated the versatility of this method by synthesising multicompositional ‘onion-like’ nanoparticles.110 The amphiphilic macroRAFT agent PMAA-b-PMMA-TTC was used to generate the seed parti-cles using ab initio emulsion polymerization. A range of poly-methacrylate (BMA, BzMA, and tBMA) blocks with various Tgs were incorporated into different multiblock copolymers. Phase separation within the nanoparticles was observed using ultra-thin cross-sectional TEM. Though TEM imaging clearly shows the formation of multi-layered ‘onion-like’ nanoparticles, it is worth noting specific challenges associated with TEM imaging as outlined by the authors. These works clearly demonstrate that how RAFT emulsion polymerization can be employed to generate multi-layered polymer nanoparticles of very specific morphology. It is of note that the microphase separation that occurs within the particles is not only merely dictated by the theoretical framework outlined in Section 4 based on wN, but also influenced by the way the polymer chains are orientated within the particles due to being anchored at the oil–water interphase via the hydrophilic R-group, and with the Z-group being located towards the core region of the particle. In fact, one can envisage that microphase separation under such con-ditions would occur even if the corresponding bulk material system did not undergo microphase separation based on pre-dictions using wN. In the case of the aforementioned PBMA-b-PSt pentablock system,109 the relevant value of wN (o 3.6)110 leads one to expect microphase separation to not occur, in contrast to what is clearly demonstrated via TEM imaging (Fig. 15). Unlike multilayered nanoparticles produced through SARM,110 which are limited to di-or triblock copolymers (AB and ABA-type blocks), the use of sequential monomer addition during emulsion polymerization allows for the generation of multicomponent layered nanoparticles in the sense that each polymer layer can in principle be tailored at will regarding the composition, layer thickness and the order of layers (within the constraints of what is possible from a RAFT emulsion polymerization perspective, of course). Overall, these examples further highlight how compartmentalization in RAFT emulsion polymerization can be a powerful tool to improve polymer control and realise complex multi-layered nanoparticles. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives Multiblock copolymers offer seemingly endless opportunities in terms of design of new advanced polymeric materials and polymeric nanoparticles. The control over the distribution of monomer units along a polymer chain with the precision seen in biopolymers found in nature, such as nucleic acids and proteins, remains a longstanding quest of polymer chemists. Multiblock copolymers can be considered as representing a step towards the ultimately desired control over the placement of each individual monomer unit. In theory, the types of multiblock copolymers that can be designed and experimen-tally prepared are virtually endless. However, in practice, var-ious constraints exist due to limitations and shortcomings of currently available synthetic methodologies. Copolymers com-prising two or three blocks have been prepared by RDRP and studied rather extensively over many years, but it is only over This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 | 3463the past decade or so that advances in RDRP have enabled the synthesis of a range of multiblock copolymers comprising an excess of three blocks. The present review has focused on the use of RAFT poly-merization implemented in aqueous emulsion polymerization for the synthesis of multiblock copolymers. This approach offers a range of advantages, both in terms of significantly expanding the range of multiblock copolymer types that are experimentally accessible, and providing access to interesting nanoparticle morphologies (most notably multilayered parti-cles). The use of RAFT emulsion polymerization allows one to benefit from effects of compartmentalization (the nanoreactor concept), which leads to an increase in the polymerization rate, thereby enabling the synthesis of multiblock copolymers of monomers with low propagation rate coefficients as well as accessing high molecular weight blocks. In this way, the use of emulsion polymerization can provide access to various bio-based monomers which often have intrinsically low polymeri-zation rates. Moreover, constraints in terms of the order of blocks of specific monomers can be significantly relaxed, thereby further expanding the library of accessible multiblock copolymer structures. Considering that one fascinating aspect of multiblock copolymers is how self-assembly in the form of microphase separation into discrete nano-sized domains pro-vides the material morphology control on length scales ranging from a few nanometers to a micrometer, it is paramount that the types of multiblock copolymers available to scientists are not overly restricted by synthetic limitations. Microphase sepa-rated polymeric materials that comprise polymer segments of distinct properties largely dictate the potential applications of multiblock copolymers. In regard to the polymer particle morphology control, there are opportunities in advanced par-ticle design both in terms of the polymer (and thus particle) composition and understanding of how particles with such intricate morphologies behave for example in paint and coat-ings applications, not to mention more high-tech applications such as drug delivery. Emulsion polymerization technologies are particularly well suited for industrial applications, given that current industrial set ups for such a well-established polymer synthesis protocol can be readily adapted for multi-block copolymer synthesis via RAFT emulsion polymerization. The synthetic capabilities in the field of multiblock copoly-mers, beyond RDRP and with other methodologies, have expanded significantly over the last decade. In order for these exciting materials to fulfill their potential, it is imperative that polymer chemists interact with physicists and material scien-tists to maximize the impact of these materials of the future. One of the features of RDRP is its simple setup, which makes it an approachable technique to non-experts, facilitating interdisciplinary work. Interdisciplinary collaboration will cre-ate a feedback loop whereby new advanced materials can be designed based on non-empirical and less trial-and-error based approaches. For example, it is currently not generally well understood to what extent the multiblock copolymer structure (e.g. block order) plays a crucial role in materials properties. Another significant area of opportunity is represented by automated high throughput synthesis, possibly even coupled with machine learning (artificial intelligence) to elucidate the complex structure–property relationship. Overall, the area of multiblock copolymers remains a field of immense future opportunities in advanced materials design. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare.

Given that polymer properties are intimately linked to the microstructure and monomer distribution along the constituent chains, it goes without saying that there exist seemingly endless opportunities in terms of fine-tuning the properties of such materials by careful consideration of the length of each block, the number and order of blocks, and the inclusion of monomers with specific functional groups.

        "1. Introduction A multiblock copolymer comprises three or more covalently linked segments of different monomer compositions (blocks).1–3 There exist seemingly endless opportunities in terms of fine-tuning the properties of such materials by careful consideration of the length of each individual block, the number of blocks, the order of blocks, and the inclusion of monomers with specific functional groups. The control of monomer sequence in polymers is one of the most important quests in contemporary polymer chemistry, with researchers striving to mimic the ability of Nature to access polymers with a ‘‘perfect’’ structure.4–6Biopolymers such as nucleic acids and proteins exhibit specia-lized functions originating in the perfectly controlled sequence distribution of monomer units and functionalities along the chain. As such, multiblock copolymers can be regarded as an important stepping-stone in this direction. Multiblock copolymers are entirely different materials from the corres-ponding mixtures of the constituent homopolymers – this is particularly evident in the case where polymer self-assembly results in microphase separation into discrete nano-sized domains (5–100 nm). The microphase separation of chemically incompatible blocks occurs when the molecular weights of the individual blocks are sufficiently high. In contrast, mixing of the corresponding chemically incompatible homopolymers results in macrophase separation on a bulk scale, and does not generate spatially periodic compositional nanostructural patterns. Precise multiblock copolymer synthesis coupled with self-assembly offers morphology control on length scales ran-ging from a few nanometers up to a micrometer. The area of multiblock copolymer synthesis from a materials science per-spective remains relatively unexplored with enormous oppor-tunities for the future development of advanced materials and applications.1–3 Given the endless possibilities of designinga Cluster for Advanced Macromolecular Design (CAMD), School of Chemical Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

Self-assembly of diblock copoly-mers has found applications in nanomedicine (e.g. drug delivery), microelectronic devices,7 and advanced plastics.1,2,8,9Multiblock copolymers can be synthesized using a variety of approaches involving methods based on reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP),10–12 click-like chemistries, and polyaddition or polycondensation.6 The focus of the present review is multiblock copolymer synthesis in aqueous emulsion polymerization using what is arguably the most versatile form of RDRP, namely reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization (Fig. 1).13–15 RDRP has had a dramatic impact on polymer chemistry, rendering hitherto inaccessible polymer structures possible, notably block copoly-mers. In regard to multiblock copolymer synthesis, it wasreported in 201116 that the exploitation of an RDRP system with extremely high livingness (end-group fidelity) makes it possible to access multiblock copolymers via iterative polymer-izations to essentially full conversion in a one-pot process, thus eliminating the need for intermediate purification steps. This pioneering work, which uses Cu(0)-mediated radical polymer-ization (also known as SET-LRP or SARA-ATRP) inspired further developments using RAFT polymerization,17–21 demonstrating that high-order multiblock copolymers comprising as many as 20 blocks could be synthesized using RAFT polymerization, exploiting monomers with high propagation rate coefficients (kp) such as acrylates and acrylamides. The process of emulsion polymerization22 entails polymer-ization occurring within monomer-swollen micelles/polymer particles on a nanodimensional scale, so-called nanoreactors.

This in turn leads to a reduction in the rate of bimolecular termination between propagating species relative to that observed in a corresponding homogeneous system (bulk/ solution), and thus a higher polymerization rate.25,34,36–38 The degree of livingness (and chain-end fidelity) in RAFT polymeriza-tion, for a given degree of polymerization, can be markedly increased relative to the corresponding homogeneous bulk or solution systems.39 The substantially higher polymerization rate in a compartmentalized system makes it possible to reach a given degree of polymerization in a significantly shorter time. As a consequence, fewer initiating radicals are required for polymeriza-tion, leading to higher livingness.17–20,40 Therefore, this approach makes possible the preparation of multiblock copolymers com-prising low kp monomers such as styrenes and methacrylates. 39–41In addition, aqueous emulsion polymerization is more environ-mentally friendly and suitable for industrial scale up, enabling easy access to the large scale synthesis of advanced functional materials.22 Emulsion polymerization yields a polymer product in the form of discrete polymer nanoparticles dispersed in water (a so-called latex). Such latices can often be directly applied in various applications, such as in paints and coatings. Moreover, the experimental access to polymer nanoparticles is of great signifi-cance – polymer nanoparticles find a wide range of applications. The morphology of polymer nanoparticles plays a key role in their properties, and multiblock copolymer nanoparticles offer interest-ing opportunities in terms of tuning of particle morphology. The present review aims to summarize the state of the art in the area of multiblock copolymer synthesis (focussing on block numbers greater than 3) and the preparation of multiblock copolymer particles (including morphological aspects) using aqueous RAFT emulsion polymerization. Significant attention is given to mechanistic/kinetic aspects that set these systems apart from their counterparts in solution or bulk RAFT poly-merization. More specifically, this review will first deal with the fundamentals of RAFT polymerization, before delving into recent advances related to the mechanistic nuances of RAFT in heterogeneous systems. This is followed by a summary of all work involved in synthesizing multiblock copolymers via RAFT mediated heterogeneous polymerization and relevant work in the periphery, finally followed by a discussion on the interplay between multiblock copolymers and particle morphology. A more general review on the synthesis of multiblock copoly-mers has been published by Becer et al.,42 while a review focussing on both sequence-controlled and sequence-defined polymers has been published by Junkers et al.6 These are relevant to the current body of work as they deal with multi-block synthesis and recognise the significance of emulsion polymerization.

        "2. RAFT polymerization The history, mechanism and application of the RAFT process have been described in numerous reviews and we only note some of the more recent here.15,43–47 RAFT polymerization, involving so-called macromonomer RAFT agents, was first reported in 1995 as a new form of controlled-growth radical polymerization for forming low dispersity (multi)block copoly-mers by (semi-batch) polymerization.48–50 The more popular form of RAFT polymerization using carbonothioylsulfanyl com-pounds (more commonly called thiocarbonylthio compounds, but this nomenclature is deprecated by IUPAC) as RAFT agents was announced in 1998.13,15 The public announcement was preceded by patent submissions by CSIRO/DuPont51,52 and Rhodia.53 A review on the historical development of RAFT has been published.50IUPAC defines RAFT polymerization as a ‘‘degenerate-transfer radical polymerization in which chain activation and chain deactivation involve a degenerative chain-transfer pro-cess, which occurs by a two-step addition-fragmentation mechanism’’.54,55 Degenerate-transfer radical polymerization is then a ‘‘reversible-deactivation polymerization in which the deactivation of the active species involves degenerative chaintransfer’’,56 and degenerative (or degenerate) chain transfer is a ‘‘chain-transfer reaction that generates a new chain carrier and a new chain-transfer agent with the same reactivity as the original chain carrier and chain-transfer agent’’.56 The essential features of the RAFT mechanism can be seen in Scheme 1. The chain transfer reactions are called degenerate given that the process entails the propagating radicals (R–PnNone) exchanging functionality with the dormant macroRAFT agents [R–Pm–XC(QX)Z]. The only distinction between the reactants and products is their respective chain lengths (n and m). As long as the rate coefficients for forward and reverse chain transfers are high, the n and m values should likewise be similar. To achieve a low Ð polymer, ideally, substantially fewer than one monomer unit will be added per activation cycle. The RAFT agent 1 and macroRAFT agent 2 (refer Scheme 2) are reactively symmetrical. The group X is usually sulfur (in carbonothioylsulfanyl RAFT agents),13 but carbon (in macro-monomer RAFT agents or sulfur-free RAFT)48–50,57 and other examples have been reported. The RAFT agent Z substituent is generally called an activating group and determines the reac-tivity of the CQS or CQC bond towards radical addition alongside the stability of the intermediates. R or R–Pn groups are the groups transferred as a consequence of RAFT. The respective radicals (R or R–PnNone) must be an effective homolytic leaving group and efficiently re-initiate polymerization to become new propagating radicals. The overall RAFT process subsequently revolves around sequential monomer unit inser-tion as indicated in Scheme 2. The R– and Z(X)CQX– function-alities of the initial RAFT agent are located at the ends of the3442 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023new macroRAFT agent. Note, however, that the RAFT process ensures that the R– and Z(X)CQX– functionalities will typically not derive from the same initial RAFT agent molecule. The ‘intermediates’ in Scheme 1 should only be transient and, in most circumstances, do not directly affect the process. However, termination involving the intermediates is generally believed the likely cause of retardation observed in many RAFT polymeriza-tions. Propagation from the intermediate (i.e., copolymerization of the RAFT agent) by the reaction of the intermediate with the monomer is a complication in macromonomer RAFT polymeriza-tion involving monosubstituted monomers.",
        "The RAFT process does not lead to radical generation. Consequently, RAFT polymerization must be initiated by a separate initiation step. Historically, this has most often involved the thermal decomposition of an added initiator. However, initiating radicals may also be generated mechani-cally, photochemically58 or in a redox process59 directly from the RAFT agent.",
        "All radical species generated in the RAFT mechanism can, in principle, be involved in the RAFT process to form new RAFTspecies or terminate by radical–radical reactions. To minimize termination events, the careful selection of reaction conditions is required. Minimizing termination for polymerizations in homogeneous solutions typically requires the targeted molecular weight to be considerably smaller than that in a comparable conventional radical polymerization. The formation of new, less active, RAFT agents from initiator-derived radicals or initiating radicals with the initial RAFT agent is also a potential cause of retardation.60 The transfer coefficients (Ctr) of the initial RAFT agent are often such that o1 monomer unit will be inserted per activation cycle. These Ctr are substantially higher than those of the macroRAFT agents formed after monomer insertion. As a result, initial RAFT agents are typically transformed to single-unit monomer insertion (SUMI) products prior to any signifi-cant formation of higher molar mass macroRAFT agents (Scheme 2).61–65 This can result in an initial period of slow monomer consumption if the value of the rate coefficient for the addition of the RNone radical to the monomer is less than the propagation rate coefficient of the monomer.",
        "This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |34432.1. Monomers in RAFT polymerization The reactivities of vinyl monomers form a continuum. Gener-ally, it is applicable to classify monomers into one of the two main classes.66,67 The double bond of ‘less activated’ mono-mers or LAMs is adjacent to a saturated carbon or one or more halogen, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur lone pairs. A less stabilised or more reactive propagating species is formed by radical addition to LAMs. The double bond of ‘more-activated’ mono-mers or MAMs is conjugated to an unsaturated system such as an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, a nitrile, or a double bond. This category of MAMs also includes maleic anhydride (MAH) and maleimides. A more stabilized propagating species is formed by radical addition to MAMs. Monomers that fall between the boundaries of MAMs and LAMs such as N-vinyl-carbazole (NVC) can be classed as intermediate activated monomers or an IAM.68 In any case, with a judicious choice of the RAFT agent, most monomers are compatible with RAFT polymerization, whether they be LAMs, MAMs, or IAMs.",
        "2.2. RAFT agents The design, selection and synthesis of RAFT agents have been described in many recent reviews.14,66,67,69–71 RAFT agent selec-tion (ZC(QS)SR or ZC(QCH2)CH2R) for specific monomer(s) and reaction conditions is vital for achieving defined molar mass dispersities and high end-group fidelity. The number of publications mentioning the various RAFT agents is displayed in Fig. 2, and is indicative of their overall popularity.",
        "The structure of a given RAFT agent, ZC(QS)SR or ZC(QCH2)CH2R, specifically the activating group, Z, and the homolytic leaving group, R, establishes its effectiveness in facilitating radical polymerization. General recommendations for substituent selection are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively.66,71The Z-group has a considerable impact on the transfer coefficient of RAFT agents. While there are a large range of possible Z-groups, it should be noted71 that, with only two differing types of the RAFT Z-group, one for MAMs (e.g., a trithiocarbonate) and another for LAMs (e.g., a xanthate), con-trol over the polymerization of the majority of monomers should be possible.71The homolytic leaving group RNone of the initial RAFT agent (ZC(QS)SR) should also be an effective initiating radical in regard to the monomer(s) to be polymerized.66,67 The rate coefficient for the addition of RNone to the monomer, ki, generally ought to be at least equivalent to the rate of propagation (kp). Values of ki for some common RNone have been summarized. 73 Systems where kp is significantly higher than ki can undergo a period of inhibition, during which the RAFT agent from its initial state is fully transformed into a macroRAFT agent. This behaviour is represented by the dashed lines present in Fig. 4.",
        "2.3. Sequence defined polymers – synthesis of (multi)block copolymers Di-, tri-and multi-blocks can be synthesized by sequential monomer addition.67,71,74,75 Attaining high end-group fidelityand block purity are of high importance; factors that influence the former generally strongly affect the latter.74 The formation of an A–B diblock copolymer with conventional initiation is considered. A population of initiator-derived chains will be generated throughout the polymerization of the first block. These are distinguished by the presence of an initiator frag-ment (I–) as the end-group instead of the RAFT agent R–group (Scheme 3). Since chains are initiated throughout the duration of polymerization, the initiator-derived chains are typically characterized by a lower Mn and a higher Ð than what is ideal for the A-block (i.e., a lower molar mass tailing is observed). Given that all chains equilibrate up to the point where termina-tion occurs, this means that the chains formed with initiator derived ends will not be the same chains that undergo termina-tion. The initiator-derived chain impurities can be removed by choosing an initiator and an initial RAFT agent such that I– and R– are the same. The initiator-derived chain impurities can also be removed by using direct photo-iniferter RAFT, photo-induced electron/energy transfer–RAFT (PET–RAFT), redox RAFT or eRAFT wherein radicals are generated directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent. The latter strategies reduce but do not completely eliminate termination as a side reaction. To the extent that termination occurs, there must exist further by-products formed due to the RAFT agent ZCS2 frag-ment. Unlike RAFT with conventional initiation, the amount of termination may be mitigated by the persistent radical effect. For every two chains initiated, between one and two dead chains will eventually be formed depending on the extent of3444 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023termination by combination vs. disproportionation. In making an AB diblock, termination during the polymerization of A-block will result in the formation of dead chains of homo-polymer A. Throughout the synthesis of the B-block, initiator-derived chains are formed, and will constitute an impurity composed of homopolymer B (Scheme 3). Termination via combination during the synthesis of the B-block will lead to the formation of some ABA triblocks. In synthesizing higher order block copolymers (tri-and multi-blocks), progressive generations beget higher degrees of complexity.21For monomers with a high kp such as acrylates and acryl-amides, only a low initiator concentration is required to achieve high polymerization rates. As a result, high (e.g., 499%) monomer conversions can be attained within an acceptable timeframe whilst maintaining the RAFT end-group fidelity. This approach was applied advantageously for the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers containing a poly(octadecyl acry-late) (PODA) block,76 where the removal of residual ODA would be laborious and difficult. A similar strategy has been used in multi-block copolymer synthesis.17,18,21,77 Nonetheless, it is typically desirable for most homogenous media polymeriza-tions to be limited in monomer conversion, e.g., o90%, so as to maximize end-group fidelity, being especially crucial where low kp monomers such as styrenes and methacrylates are involved. At higher monomer conversions, the importance oftermination events progressively increases. As a result, when intermediate purification steps between each block is undesir-able, such as when using high-throughput methods,78–80 it is more convenient to conduct the sequential addition of mono-mers whilst unreacted monomers from the previous block still remains. This compromise leads to the formation of what are called quasi-block copolymers.78,81 When two distinct mono-mers A and B are employed, the resultant ‘‘quasi-block’’ will be a gradient copolymer [i.e., P(A)-b-P(A-grad-B)], with the mono-mer reactivity ratios affecting the exact composition of the ‘‘quasi-block’’. The ‘‘quasi-block’’ composition may have detri-mental impacts on the desired polymer properties, especially in applications such as electronics, where the block purity is of the upmost importance, and thus must be accounted for when designing polymer syntheses. The factors that dictate the R-group selection also determine the order of block construction in block copolymer syntheses. It is necessary for the propagating species generated from the initial block (PANone) to be a good homolytic leaving group in regard to that of the following block (PBNone). The PANone radical from the block generated initially must undergo an efficient addition to B monomer(s) that the following block will be composed of. For instance, in the synthesis of a diblock comprising polystyrene and poly(vinyl acetate), P(St-b-VAc), the PStNone adds VAc only slowly.82 This results in a very slow consumption ofThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3445the PSt macroRAFT. Moreover, any residual St causes signifi-cant retardation. The problem can be solved by forming a short block of methyl acrylate (MA) between the PSt and PVAc blocks to form PSt-b-PMA-b-PVAc.82,83 The length of the PMA block should be designed such that at least a single MA unit is at the end of every chain, and all residual St is consumed. An alternate solution is to copolymerize VAc with a small amount of MA. The reactivity ratios between St/MA and MA/VAc will lead to the overall composition being PSt-b-(PMA-grad-PVAc)-b-PVAc.82,83Another method of successfully synthesizing block copoly-mers with the ‘‘wrong’’ monomer-order, or when using macro-RAFT agents with low transfer coefficients, is through the use of starved-feed addition protocol.84,85 The protocol was used to prepare a diblock comprising polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate), PSt-b-PMMA, St block first, and with 11 as the initial RAFT agent. In this example, semi-batch emulsion con-ditions with continuous slow monomer addition maintained the instantaneous monomer conversion between 80 and 95%.86The consumption rate of an initial RAFT or macroRAFT agent in RAFT polymerization may be estimated via the following expression (eqn (1)):These complexities in block copolymer synthesis in bulk or solution has provided much impetus for the furtherdevelopment of block copolymer synthesis in dispersed sys-tems. This same approach was also utilized in earlier work for the preparation of block copolymers exhibiting low dispersities from macromonomer RAFT agents.48,49 This strategy is dis-cussed further in Sections 3.2 and 4.1.873. RAFT polymerization in dispersed systems 3.1. Emulsion polymerization Radical polymerization can be conducted as a homogeneous system (solution/bulk) or as a dispersed system. There are a number of different types of dispersed systems,88 namely emulsion polymerization,22 miniemulsion polymerization,89 microemulsion polymerization,90,91 precipitation polymeriza-tion, dispersion polymerization,92,93 and suspension polymer-ization. Some of these systems may seem similar, and there is considerable confusion and lack of consistency in the scientific literature in regard to terminology, in particular regarding emulsion and miniemulsion polymerization.94 Importantly, the systems listed differ mainly in terms of the particle for-mation mechanism, and consequently also in terms of the final particle size, although there is considerable overlap in regard to the latter. The reader is referred to the literature for detailed explanations and definitions of each system, in particular within the context of RDRP/RAFT.88,95 Emulsion polymeriza-tion is by far the most common and most commercially important of these processes. Emulsion polymerization is attractive for a number of reasons: it is easy to perform, is3446 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023suitable for industrial scale production, provides high polymer-ization rates and high molecular weights (the latter specifically referring to conventional radical polymerization), and gene-rates the polymer product in the form of polymer nanoparticles dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase (a so-called ‘‘latex’) that can often be used as is, commonly with suitable additives, in the applications of paints and coatings for example. A conventional emulsion polymerization begins with a stirred mixture of water, surfactants, monomers and typically a water-soluble initiator. Particle formation occurs in the aqueous phase (not from monomer droplets as in a miniemulsion polymerization) via micellar or homogeneous nucleation in the approximate conversion range of 0–10% (Interval I). Monomer droplets co-exist with monomer-swollen particles over the approximate conversion range of 10–40% (Interval II) – during this interval, monomer is consumed by propagation in polymer particles, and further the monomer diffuses across the aqueous phase from monomer droplets and is absorbed by polymer particles. At some point, typically around 40% conversion, all monomer droplets have been consumed, and monomer-swollen particles remain where propagation continues. The typical particle size range obtained from an emulsion poly-merization is 100–600 nm with relatively narrow particle size distributions.",
        "3.2. RAFT emulsion polymerization based on self-assembly Conventional emulsion polymerizations are traditionally stabi-lized via the use of surfactants. Issues with superswelling, film formation, degradation of physical properties and environ-mental impact have however galvanized the pursuit of RAFT mediated emulsion polymerizations free of conventional surfactants.11,96–100 The most elegant and convenient way ofconducting RAFT emulsion polymerization is to trigger particle nucleation via self-assembly of an amphiphilic macroRAFT species, thereby bypassing the need for a conventional low MW surfactant. Such a macroRAFT species can either be prepared in a separate step (as in Scheme 4) or form as a part of the emulsion polymerization in a one pot process. The latter case has become known as polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA),101–107 and can be implemented using in principle any RDRP system, but RAFT is by far the method of choice to date. However, PISA based on addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) polymerization is also possible.108 Ferguson et al.101,102 reported the first work on PISA in emulsion in 2002, and a few years after that it was realized that PISA can be used to access a range of higher order morphologies such as worms and vesicles.103–107 Such self-assembled systems generally see the R-group and the solvophilic block anchored at the particle interface, while the hydrophobic block extends within the particle. This has been exploited for the synthesis of covalently linked core–shell particles,101,102 and later for the formation of multi-layered particles,109,110 which will be discussed in more detail in Section 5.2.",
        "3.3. Compartmentalization effects (the nanoreactor concept) The kinetics of emulsion polymerizations have long been known to be profoundly influenced by effects of compartmen-talization, i.e. the confinement of the polymerization to small discrete spaces (nanoreactors) as initially set out by Smith-Ewart theory within the framework of so-called zero-one kinetics.22,111 The basic concept of zero-one kinetics is that if particles (nanoreactors) are sufficiently small, the time it takes for two radicals to undergo bimolecular termination within a given particle is so short (confined space effect) that significantThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3447propagation does not occur before a termination event. As such, over any kinetically significant length of time, particles will contain either one or zero radicals. The resultant segrega-tion of propagating radicals between particles means that the overall rate of termination is reduced. For conventional (not RDRP) radical polymerization, this leads to higher polymeriza-tion rates and higher molecular weights than in corresponding homogeneous systems (Fig. 5).",
        "The translation of these concepts to RDRP systems is far from trivial, and extensive theoretical work has to date been conducted to clarify how the three most common RDRP systems (RAFT polymerization, atom transfer radical polymer-ization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP)) behave under compartmentalized conditions.34,36 We will here focus exclusively on RAFT polymerization, while noting that compartmentalization effects cannot be treated the same way for degenerative transfer systems (e.g. RAFT) and systems that proceed via the persistent radical effect112 (e.g. ATRP/ NMP). Although there are a range of more subtle kinetic effects of compartmentalization on RAFT polymerization,113–116 the overall effect of the most importance to the subject of multiblock copolymer synthesis in emulsion polymerization is that of the segregation of propagating radicals as alluded to earlier. If two propagating radicals are located in two separate particles, they are unable to undergo bimolecular termination. As such, the overall rate of bimolecular termination is reduced, leading to a higher RAFT polymerization rate for the same reason that a conventional (non-RDRP) radical polymerization is also typically faster in a compartmentalized system.",
        "Within the context of multiblock copolymer synthesis, the concept of ‘‘livingness’’, or chain-end fidelity, is crucial. The livingness is defined as the number fraction of chains that contain a RAFT end group capable of undergoing further chain extension. In RAFT polymerization involving an exogenous initiator (unlike PET–RAFT117), the livingness can be directly related to the number of initiator radicals generating new chains, given that every radical generated (before or after undergoing propagation and/or chain transfer events) mustnated from the initiator; in this term, f is the initiator effi-ciency, kd is the rate constant for decomposition, and fc is the coupling factor (0 r fc r 1, where a value of 0 represents all termination occurring via disproportionation, and a value of 0 represents all termination occurring via combination). It follows that one seeks to minimize the initiator concen-tration, the obvious trade-off being between livingness and polymerization rate.17–20 Now, given that the segregation effect leads to an increase in polymerization rate, one can use RAFT emulsion polymerization (and other heterogeneous systems such as miniemulsion polymerization) at substantially lower rates of initiation than the corresponding homogeneous system.17–20,39,40 This enables access to considerably higher degrees of livingness in RAFT emulsion polymerization sys-tems, which is crucial for multiblock copolymer synthesis which involves a number of successive chain extensions. In the same way, exploitation of compartmentalization in RAFT emulsion polymerization has enabled the synthesis of multiblock copolymers comprising slowly propagating mono-mers such as styrenes and methacrylates,39–41 which is extre-mely challenging in homogeneous systems due to low polymerization rates requiring high initiation rates leading to low livingness.",
        "3.4. Monomer concentration at a polymerization locus One of the key parameters that dictate the level of control over the MWD in all RDRP systems is the number of monomer units that are added per activation-deactivation cycle. The lower the number of monomer units added by propagation while the3448 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023polymer chain is in the active state (i.e. in the form of a propagating radical), the lower the value of the dispersity Ð of the MWD.118 The number of monomer units added per activa-tion cycle depends on the rate coefficients for propagation and deactivation, as well as the reactant concentrations (see discussion related to eqn (1) in Section 2.3). In the case of RAFT polymerization, the reactant concentrations of concern are the monomer concentration and the RAFT end group concen-tration. Now, in Interval I and Interval II (see above), emulsion polymerization features the presence of both monomer dro-plets and polymer particles, with polymerization only occurring in the latter while the monomer droplets merely act as mono-mer reservoirs feeding monomers to the particles as monomers is consumed in the particles. The result is that the number of monomer molecules per number of RAFT end groups at the locus of polymerization, i.e. in the polymer particles, is lower than it would be in the corresponding homogeneous system, because the monomer in the monomer droplets is excluded (Fig. 6).",
        "As such, theory dictates that this effect would lead to lower Ð in emulsion polymerization than in the corresponding homo-geneous system.41,119 Moad and coworkers reported that low dispersity methacrylate-based copolymers can be prepared from methacrylate macromonomers according to so-called ‘‘sulfur-free RAFT’’ emulsion polymerization performed as the semi-batch process with a continuous monomer feed such that the instantaneous monomer conversion was ca 495%.48,49,84,120 Methacrylate macromonomers exhibit very low Ctr values in comparison with typical RAFT agents, and satisfactory control over the MWD and living character can thus only be obtained under conditions where Ctr is artificially increased by the virtue of a low monomer concentration. This concept also plays a key role in the work reported by Engelis et al.,87 who synthe-sized methacrylate-based multiblock copolymers employing ‘‘sulfur-free RAFT’’ emulsion polymerization with methacrylate macromonomers also using a semi-continuous process with acontinuous monomer feed. It has also recently been demon-strated that the in-built monomer feeding mechanism from droplets to the particle phase in emulsion polymerization can be exploited to dramatically improve the performance of polymerizations involving a RAFT agent with relatively low transfer constants (Ctr). 41 It is important to highlight that this in-built effect should be absent in miniemulsion polymeriza-tion due to the fact that monomer droplet nucleation is the dominant particle formation mechanism and there is no discrete droplet phase.",
        "3.5. Initial conformation of macroRAFT The successful chain extension of multiblock copolymers is heavily influenced by the macroRAFT species. There are a number of general factors that contribute to the ‘success’ of a given macroRAFT agent, though not all such factors apply equally for every system. It is important that the precursor macroRAFT retains a high degree of livingness, and as such long inhibition periods are not ideal.95,121 The pH of ab initio emulsion systems mediated by macroRAFT containing PAA or PMAA units has been long known to significantly influence both nucleation time and colloidal stability.102,122–124 Alkaline conditions beget good colloidal stability due to electrostatic repulsion between macroRAFT stabilized particles, generally at the cost of control due to the increased nucleation time (more micelles due to lower critical micelle concentration (CMC)) and/ or hydrolysis of the trithiocarbonate RAFT agent end groups. Acidic conditions generally give inferior colloidal stability but better control; conducting polymerization under acidic condi-tions until nucleation, upon which the system is made alkaline, e.g. with NaOH, has proven successful in mitigating this issue.121 Aqueous phase termination due to radical transfer to stabilizing PAA units may also play a role in extending the nucleation period.121,125 Generally, initiator concentrations and decomposition rates are also important in determining the fraction of living chains.17,126 It is well established that the macroRAFT agents employed in ab initio, surfactant free macro-RAFT mediated aqueous emulsion polymerization, must be water soluble, though not so much such that longer inhibi-tion times and homogenous nucleation start to become significant.127,128 Solubility can be controlled by the choice of monomers and targeted degrees of polymerization for the hydrophilic and, where relevant, hydrophobic blocks. In cases where the macroRAFT species is poorly water soluble, a cosol-vent may be used.129 To achieve water solubility, the macro-RAFT typically contains hydrophilic monomer units such as methacrylic acid (MAA),130–133 acrylic acid (AA),121,134 N,N-di-methylacrylamide,135,136 N-acryloylmorpholine,137 and 2-(dimethyl-amino)ethyl methacrylate.138–140 It is also possible to use RAFT agents with hydrophilic cationic Z-groups in this context.141 After the formation of particles, the hydrophilic segment acts as the colloidal stabilizer. In the synthesis of high molecular weight polymers, as the particle surface area increases with increasing molecular weight, the steric stabilization of the macroRAFT is often not sufficient to prevent colloidal instability in the system, resulting in coagulation. To overcome this issue,This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3449polyelectrolytes such as PMAA40,110,119,142 and PAA109,143,144 are used as the preferred hydrophilic block in both amphiphilic macroRAFT and PISA approaches. In implementing PMAA or PAA macroRAFTs in an emulsion polymerization system, the initial chain conformation of the macroRAFT significantly influences the polymerization success.",
        "The conformation of PMAA under acidic conditions (opH = 5.5.) has been shown to be a hyper-coiled aggregate for both short and long chains.130,145–147 Upon increasing the pH above 5.5, a conformation transition from a hyper-coiled state to a water swollen state occurs due to the increase in hydrophilicity caused by deprotonation of MAA units.145,148 Under acidic conditions, PAA has been shown to only adopt a hyper-coiled aggregate state above 16 500 g molNone1.146 Short chains (i.e. less than 5000 g molNone1, generally DP o50), which are most com-monly used in macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymerization, adopt a loosely packed structure. The cause for this difference in the chain conformation is the additional methyl group of MAA, which favours the interior of the hydrophobic domain, thus driving the macroRAFT to adopt a coil structure.145 Fluorescence studies by Thompson et al.147 show that under acidic conditions, the hydrophobicity of the Z-group does not affect the formation of hyper-coiled aggregates for PMAA-TTC based macroRAFTs with molecular weights between 2000 and 10 000 g molNone1. The addition of a hydrophobic block of PMMA to PMAA-TTC macroRAFTs was demonstrated to not affect the chain conformation under acidic conditions. Under conditions above the conformational transition point at pH = 5.5, a hydrophobic domain was still present according to the fluores-cence data. The use of a macroRAFT agent comprising more hydrophobic monomers such as BMA or St instead of MMA may drive the conformation towards a more micellar nature; however, the macroRAFT agent water solubility would be reduced. This would limit the macroRAFT concentration that can be employed in the polymerization, thus reducing the benefit of rapid particle nucleation and minimal particle aggre-gation often observed in systems with micelles.109,134 In contrast to PMAA-TTC, PAA-TTC was shown in fluorescence123,147 and DLS147 data to not adopt the hyper-coiled structure regardless of hydrophobicity of the Z-group. The addition of a small hydro-phobic block of PSt to the PAA-TTC macroRAFT does cause a change in the conformation. Fluorescence and DLS studies indicate that the macroRAFT adopts a micellar structure with a PSt hydrophobic domain. This micellar structure is present under both acidic and basic conditions.147The presence of a hydrophobic domain (a hyper-coiled aggregate comprising a few chains) has a drastic effect on the mechanism of RAFT emulsion PISA polymerization. The hyper-coiled aggregation adopted by PMAA-TTC macroRAFT agents at low pH leads to an increased hydrophobic monomer concen-tration around the RAFT moiety in the initial reaction medium.123,130,131 This favours rapid chain extension, which leads to the polymer chains reaching the critical length to undergo nucleation with only a short induction period.131 In the case of PMAA-TTC macroRAFT at higher pH130 or PAA-TTC-based macroRAFTs123,131 where no significant hydrophobicdomains are present, the concentration of hydrophobic mono-mers in the vicinity of active chains is markedly reduced. This leads to a much slower growth of the hydrophobic block. Additionally, the more open water-swollen structure indicates that a longer hydrophobic block is needed before self-assembly can occur, and also increases the likelihood of hydrolysis of the RAFT agent. These factors all contribute to these systems having a long induction period. In amphiphilic macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymeriza-tion, the particle nucleation mechanism can vary depending on the nature of the macroRAFT. A commonly employed macro-RAFT in the literature is PAA-b-PSt-TTC.109,121,134,143,144 As mentioned above, this macroRAFT adopts a micellar struc-ture in water and as a result, the particle nucleation occurs via micellar nucleation. Huang et al.134 reported the successful synthesis of PSt seed latexes employing PAA-b-PSt-TTC with varying block lengths of PAA and PSt. Full conversion was reached within two hours with little to no induction period observed. The short induction period and colloidal stability of the micelles lead to less particle aggregation relative to compar-able PISA systems, resulting in a smaller particle size.109 The disadvantages of this macroRAFT are the laborious purification process to synthesize the macroRAFT, as well as the lower livingness (chain end functionality) of the macroRAFT com-pared to the corresponding PAA or PMAA macroRAFTs dis-cussed above.149 Khan et al.110,119 and Clothier et al.40,142 employed PMAA-b-PMMA-TTC to synthesize a variety of methacrylate-based seed latexes. The initial conformation under acidic conditions is similar to that of PMAA-TTC hydro-philic macroRAFTs and the particle nucleation mechanism is similar as well. The presence of the PMMA block however limits the macroRAFT concentration at which seed latexes can be synthesized – the macroRAFT only has limited solubility in water and as a consequence, systems employing PMAA-b-PMMA-TTC cannot have as high solid contents as PMAA-TTC systems for the same targeted DP.1493.6. R-and Z-group hydrophobicity In conventional emulsion polymerizations with an aqueous phase initiator, initiator derived radicals located in the aqueous phase undergo propagation with aqueous phase monomer to generate oligomeric radicals.22 If the concentration of surfac-tants is below the CMC, these radicals will propagate until they either terminate or reach a critical degree of polymerization ( jcrit), upon which they become insoluble in water. Once jcrit has been reached, the radicals will precipitate to form a primary particle.150–152 The primary particles formed will undergo limited coagulation with other primary particles until a more colloidally stable particle is formed from the ever-increasing surface charge. At this point, the particle can absorb an appreciable amount of monomer.22 For concentrations of sur-factants above the CMC, or once the particle formation is complete, the accepted mechanism by which radicals enter particles is that which was developed by Maxwell et al.153 The oligomeric radicals propagate until the number of monomer units reaches a critical length (z-mer); these z-mers are then3450 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023able to enter into the particles or monomer-swollen micelles. In conventional emulsion polymerization systems, these entered radicals can propagate with monomers within the particle, terminate with another radical or exit the particle. Radical exit can only occur after a chain transfer to monomer event, in which a monomeric radical is generated with suffi-cient water solubility to exit the particle.22In macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymerization, the entered radical can also interact with the RAFT moiety. During the pre-equilibrium stage of the RAFT polymerization, as the R-group fragments and forms a radical, if the radical does not have sufficient hydrophobicity, it can undergo exit from the particle. The exit of the R-group has been shown to be a kinetically significant event.154,155 Huang et al.134 showed that in the RAFT emulsion polymerization of styrene, the expelled PAA macroradical can exit the particle (Scheme 5A), leading to a long induction period. Numerous studies have demon-strated R-group induced exit when employing low MW RAFT agents.154,156,157 Minimizing R-group exit means employing anR-group such that the generated macroradical during the RAFT pre-equilibrium is sufficiently hydrophobic that exit does not occur. Examples include using PMAA130,131 over PAA as the hydrophilic section or adding a small hydrophobic block to the R-group of PAA121,134 macroRAFT systems. Recently, Guimarães et al.131 demonstrated that RAFT agents can suffer from the so-called Z-group induced RAFT exit in macroRAFT mediated emulsion polymerizations. PMAA-based macroRAFT agents with varying hydrophobicity of Z-groups were employed in the RAFT PISA emulsion polymer-ization of styrene. When RAFT agents containing butyl and dodecyl Z-groups were used, the polymerization reached full conversion within 2 h with low dispersities (Ð o 1.30). When the more hydrophilic propionic acid Z-group was employed, a low polymerization rate was observed, only reaching 53% conversion after 6 h and exhibiting poor RAFT control. This difference is attributed to the Z-group induced exit. During the RAFT pre-equilibrium, the initiator derived radical reacts with the macroRAFT agent to form an R-group macroradical and aThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3451Z-group RAFT species containing the RAFT moiety and the short initiator derived moiety. The propionic acid Z-group is sufficiently hydrophilic for the Z-group RAFT species to undergo exit from the particle. This results in the loss of the RAFT moiety from the hydrophobic domain (Scheme 5B). As a consequence, particle aggregation occurs due to fewer amphi-philic chains and the extent of swelling with styrene is lowered due to the reduced rate of chain extension. Both these factors contribute to a reduction in the polymerization rate. To avoid the Z-group induced exit, the Z-group on the RAFT agent must have sufficient hydrophobicity such that the exit of the formed Z-group RAFT species is energetically unfavourable. The most commonly employed examples are trithiocarbonates containing a long alkyl chain Z-group.130,1314. Sequential seeded emulsion polymerization for multiblock synthesis Seeded emulsion polymerization is similar to ab initio emulsion polymerization, with the exception of the presence of a colloid-ally stable seed latex whose particles become the locus of polymerization instead of micelles/aggregates. Subsequently, seeded emulsion polymerizations forgo the nucleation step characteristic of their ab initio counterpart.22 Rather, polymer-ization commences at either Interval II or III depending on the monomer concentration, with no new particles being formed if the seed particles are sufficiently able to capture oligomeric radical species.158 As such, seeded emulsion polymerizations have relatively good batch reproducibility and control over the particle size and rate, also providing a greater degree of control over morphology, e.g. core–shell, hemispherical particles, etc.159,160 In terms of RAFT, seeded emulsion polymerization was initially used to mitigate issues with RAFT agent transport to the locus of polymerization and diminish complexities associated with nucleation.161,162 Previous studies used acetone to transport the RAFT agent to the seed prior to polymerization; issues with inhibition, retardation, control and colloidal stabi-lity were however prevalent.84,102,156,163 Results improved when the RAFT agent was exclusively located within the particles.161 To this end, as alluded to in Section 3, the use of an amphi-philic block copolymer comprising both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments chain extended from the RAFT agent, self-assembling into micelles as the locus of polymerization, has proved advantageous in both mitigating these issues and removing the need for conventional surfactants.101,102,164 This, in combination with the rate increasing influence of the segregation effect has improved the versatility of the strategy, leading to a diverse and growing array of multiblock copoly-mers able to be synthesized.",
        "Seeded emulsion polymerization can also be employed for the preparation of complex macromolecular architectures such as multiblock copolymers. The breakthrough work by Moad and coworkers on rapid, high conversion multiblock synthesis via sulfur-free RAFT emulsion polymerization in a semi-continuousprocess demonstrated promising results in the synthesis of a well controlled heptablock copolymer (Fig. 7A).48 Haddleton and coworkers further extended this strategy to the successful pre-paration of a wide range of precise, high-order, multiblock copolymers comprising various methacrylates. An undecablock (11 blocks comprising four different methacrylates) was success-fully prepared as demonstrated by the clear shift of SEC traces towards high molecular weight after each polymerization cycle.165 This method is very robust and adaptable to a wide range of methacrylates, and can be easily scaled up due to the industrial relevance of emulsion polymerization. Armes and coworkers demonstrated the robustness of PISA in the emulsion polymerization of tetrablock copolymers com-prising alternating poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) and PBMA blocks, chain extended from a hydrophilic PMAA macro-RAFT via sequential addition (PMAA56-b-PBMA500-b-PBzMA500-b-PBMA500 and PMAA56-b-PBzMA500-b-PBMA500-b-PBzMA500). 167 These syntheses were conducted in an automated workflow robot (Chemspeed Autoplant A100, Fig. 8A) – five repetitions of both PMAA56-b-PBMA500 and PMAA56-b-PBzMA500 diblocks in the robot gave a high degree of consistency in terms of the MWD, conversion, and particle diameter between polymeriza-tions. Subsequently, high-throughput syntheses of the tetra-blocks to high molecular weights (B130 000 g molNone1) conducted in the Chemspeed A100 begat broad yet unimodal MWDs (1.5 o Ð o 1.9, Fig. 8B and C). Multiblock copolymer synthesis is often a laborious task in terms of weighing reac-tants, block addition, and sampling that only becomes more arduous as the number of blocks increases. Automation of the polymerization process presents promising possibilities in terms of both the synthesis of multiblock copolymers too impractical to conduct on a laboratory scale and high-throughput synthesis that would otherwise have been per-formed one by one. Thompson et al. further explored the utility of PISA through the polymerization of a PSt seed from which an alternating PBMA and PSt hexablock copolymer was synthesized.149 Clear MWD shifting and dispersities below 1.5 were obtained (Fig. 8D); in both PISA studies, high solids contents (SC 4 30%) were additionally accessed. Recently, Guerrero-Santos’s group developed a technique for the incorporation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic mono-mers in a multiblock copolymer in a dispersed system.168 This work was based on their previous use of dialkoxyamine trithio-carbonate as a dual initiator-transfer agent,169 with NMP and RAFT polymerizations occurring in tandem. In their more recent work, this same RAFT/NMP CTA was first chain extended with acrylic acid (AA), upon which it was further sequentially chain extended in dispersion with polystyrene (PAA-b-PSt-b-PAA) via PISA. Following this, 4-styrene sulfonate (SSNa) was used to chain extend from the hydrophilic PAA arms of the previous triblock at the particle surface via surface initiated NMP (PSSNa-b-PAA-b-PSt-b-PAA-b-PSSNa).168 The RAFT moiety, being confined to the particle core, is at this point inaccessible to the water soluble SSNa. This represents a significant step in multiblock synthesis, especially since non-macroRAFT multiblock copolymers comprising both hydrophobic and3452 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023hydrophilic polymer blocks are seldom seen in the literature. These researchers have also synthesized heptablock copoly-mers with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks in solution via RAFT with relatively low dispersities (Ð o 1.6).170 On the topic of surface functionalization, conducting RAFT polymerization in heterogeneous systems using Z-type macro-RAFTs (the solvophilic block is covalently bonded to the Z-group instead of the R-group as is more commonly seen) is another potential avenue for multiblock synthesis.171 Additional advantages include easier surface functionalization and removal of both the RAFT moiety and the solvophilic block, if desired.172,173 It thus may be of interest to use such macro-RAFTs for the synthesis of multiblock copolymers; block copo-lymers have already been synthesized via PISA and dispersion polymerization in this manner.171–174While previous systems exhibit relatively low molecular weights for multiblock copolymers, Clothier et al. demon-strated that through prudent control over experimental para-meters in conjunction with a judicious choice of the colloidal stabilizing macroRAFT, high molecular weight multiblock copolymers can be synthesized with low reaction times (30 min per block), low dispersities, and high conversions.40 This was achieved even for low kp monomers (methacrylates),courtesy of the compartmentalization effect in emulsion polymerization. An amphiphilic macroRAFT synthesized via solution polymerization was used in the polymerization of a PBMA seed latex, whose particles would act as nanoreactors for subsequent sequential seeded emulsion polymerizations of multiblock copolymers. Using this strategy, PBMA deca-block homopolymers and a multicompositional heptablock (PBMA275-b-PBzMA100-b-PtBMA100-b-PiBMA100-b-PHMA100-b-PEMA100-b-PMMA100) comprising seven different sequentially added methacrylate blocks were synthesized to high conver-sion, high molecular weights (4100 000 g molNone1), and precisely tailored compositions. In a similar manner, a methacrylate heptablock (PBMA100-b-PHMA20-b-PBMA20-b-PHMA20-b-PBMA20-b-PHMA20-b-PBMA20) comprising alternating blocks of BMA and HMA was synthesized in a later study by Richardson et al via sequential monomer addition to demonstrate the robustness of systems exploiting the in-built feed mechanism characteristic of emulsion polymerizations.41 Multiblock copolymers exhibiting multilayered morphology with PSt and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) alternating blocks (PSt200-b-P(BA175-co-St25)-b-PSt200-b-P(BA175-co-St25)-b-PSt200) were also reported by Guimaraes et al. 109 This work was later expanded upon with the synthesis of multilayered particles comprising styrene and a variety of methacrylateThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem.

There is growing interest surrounding the mechanical properties multiblock copolymers can afford in comparison to diblocks and triblocks, random copolymers, and homo-polymers.175–177 In 2016 Lei and coworkers synthesized penta-block copolymers comprising PSt and PBA via dropwise sequen-tial monomer addition using a symmetrical RAFT agent.178 Though dispersities were high (Ð 4 2), promising results regarding the mechanical properties of multiblock copolymers were observed, namely improved torque values and impact strength compared to equivalent random copolymers, support-ing similar results gained from triblock analyses. This was subsequently expanded on with the synthesis of an octablock via macroRAFT mediated sequential emulsion polymerization, also comprising alternating PSt and PBA blocks (PSt176-PBA286)4. 144 Molecular weights were high (4100 000 g molNone1) though relatively high dispersities were achieved (Ð = 1.8 for the final block). Tensile properties were demonstrated to signifi-cantly improve with an increasing number of blocks, a promis-ing result for broadening the avenues of applications for multiblock copolymers. Further studies by the group focussing on ‘hard–soft–hard’ multiblock copolymers once again com-prising PSt and PBA confirmed the superior tensile strength and toughness of (PStm-b-PBAn-b-PStm)2 compared to those of both PStm-b-PBAn-b-PStm and PSt2m-b-PBA2n-b-PSt2m, demon-strating the importance of both the molecular weight and numbers of blocks in terms of mechanical properties.143 Phase separation and high PBA content were also associated with better mechanical properties. Applications in robotics are already being explored, with the microphase separation of PSt-b-PBA-b-PSt allowing for a low Tg while maintaining struc-tural integrity compared to alternative materials, in the con-struction of ‘wings’ for a deep-sea exploratory soft robot.179 Recently, Okamura’s group in collaboration with Zetterlund and coworkers through the synthesis and analysis of di-, tetra-and octablock copolymers comprising alternating PBMA and PSt blocks (PBMA400-b-PSt400, (PBMA200-b-PSt200)2, and (PBMA100-b-PSt100)4 respectively) shed light on how varying the number of blocks in equivalent molecular weight multiblock copolymers affects their efficacy as compatibilizers between polymer blend films.166 For this system, multiblock copolymers were demon-strated to reduce the phase separation domain size compared to the corresponding diblock copolymer. Similar observations were detected by Dadmun and coworkers;180 a series of multiblocks comprising alternating PSt and PMMA blocks (diblocks, triblocks, pentablocks, and heptablocks) used to compatibilize PSt/PMMA interfaces saw stronger interfaces with an increasing number of blocks.181 It was observed however that the trend stopped at the heptablock, which showed comparatively poorer compatibiliza-tion; this was attributed to the low block molecular weight, once3454 | Chem.

        "There are a number of techniques involving RAFT with a significant room for development, especially in the realm of multiblock copolymer synthesis.182,183 Alternatives to thermal initiation have been receiving special attention given the pos-sibility of conducting polymerizations under mild to ambient conditions, granting of spatial and temporal control, the sup-pression of undesirable initiator-derived by-products, and a movement towards more environmentally friendly, less energy intensive and sustainable polymerizations.183–187 Since the seminal works by Boyer in 2014,185,186 PET–RAFT has proven to be a promising technique in multiblock copolymer syn-thesis;188,189 photo-iniferter RAFT, whereby the RAFT agent is activated directly by irradiation as opposed to via photocatalyst, has also shown promise in this area.190–192 However, applica-tions in dispersed systems remain rare and unoptimized due to their opacity and the necessity of light penetration.193,194 The generation of radicals via biocatalysis offers a sustainable and efficient approach to polymerization initiation.195 While the technique has been applied to both conventional radical polymerization196 and RDRP197,198 for some time, it was only in 2015 when An and coworkers applied biocatalysis by the established horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/H2O2/acetylacetone (ACAC) system to RAFT polymerization, demonstrating good control of a number of monomers under both homogenous and heterogenous conditions.187 A similar system was used for the synthesis of four decablock copolymers via aqueous solution polymerization comprising either one or both of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) and poly(4-acryloylmorpholine) (PAML) through the sequential addition of monomers and constituents of the HRP/H2O2/ACAC system (PDMA150–(PAML50– PDMA50)4–PAML50 and PDMA100–(PAML50–PAML50–PDMA50)3). 199 Dispersities ranged from 1.4 to 1.5; although the polymerization was conducted in a homogenous system, enzyme-catalyzed poly-merizations in emulsion mediated by both SARA-ATRP (SET-LRP) for the synthesis of diblocks comprising PBMA and PMMA200 and RAFT polymerization for the synthesis of various triblocks201 suggest the transition into multiblock synthesis via RAFT in emulsion would be feasible. Similarly, redox initiated RAFT has instances of multiblock copolymer synthesis in the literature,202,203 while the emulsion polymerization of styrene has been conducted via electrochemically initiated RAFT (eRAFT).204 This led to the successful seeded emulsion poly-merization of PBMA200–PSt100–PMS100 (PMS = p-methylstyrene) triblock and PBMA200–PSt100–PBA100–PSt100 tetrablock copoly-mers to low dispersities (Ð = 1.24 and Ð = 1.16 respectively).205 Conducting the polymerization via seeded emulsion gave the advantage of segregating the RAFT moiety from the working electrode, given that contact between them has been demon-strated to result in the irreversible consumption of the RAFT agent and passivation of the electrode.205–207 Finally, the combination of step-growth (SG) and RAFT polymerization is an innovative strategy to synthesize complex macromolecular structures. The successful combination of Diels–Alder step-growth and RAFT polymerization was recently employed forthe preparation of multi-segmented macromolecules.208,209 Polymer chains were equipped with several RAFT agents dis-tributed along the backbone of the chains. This elegant strategy could potentially be explored for the generation of high-order multiblock copolymers (420 blocks) via few (1–2) chain extension reactions from the mid-chain RAFT moieties – significantly redu-cing the number of polymerization cycles. Exploration of the synthesis of multiblock copolymers in these unique systems is expected to be relatively easy to adapt to heterogeneous conditions and a worthwhile endeavour for future studies.",
        "4.1. Order of monomer addition The synthesis of di-or multi-block copolymers via sequential RAFT polymerization encounters an intrinsic limitation regard-ing the order of monomer addition.74,84,210–212 The typical preparation of an AB block copolymer involves RAFT polymer-ization of monomer A, followed by chain extension with mono-mer B, resulting in the AB diblock copolymer. However, according to the RAFT mechanism (Scheme 1), the propagating radical generated from the first monomer (A) must present a better leaving group than the propagating species from mono-mer B to result in ‘‘forward’’ fragmentation and, consequently, successful block formation. Otherwise, ‘‘backward’’ fragmenta-tion can occur leading to the homopolymerization of monomer B instead of the desired chain extension. A classic example of this limitation is the synthesis of block copolymers comprising methacrylate-and styrene-based monomers. The chain extension of a methacrylate macroRAFT with styrene can be successfully conducted leading to a well-defined diblock copolymer. On the other hand, the poor chain extension of a styrene-based macro-RAFT with methacrylate monomers is usually observed.212 This limitation regarding the order of polymerization obviously repre-sents a serious impediment on the preparation of high-ordered multiblock copolymers via sequential RAFT polymerizations. The use of a comonomer during RAFT polymerization of the second block can be implemented to assist in the successful preparation of the di-or multiblock copolymer in the wrong order of monomer addition.109,110,119,166,213 This strategy is based on the use of a low content of comonomer (o10 wt%) which will lead to the reduction of Ctr during chain extension. The principle behind this concept is presumably the formation of macroradical adducts with a terminal comonomer unit comprising a better leaving group (mkb, Scheme 1). 212,214 This strategy was built on previous works reported by Charleux and coworkers130,213,215–217 on the successfully controlled polymer-ization of methacrylates via nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP). For most applications, such low contents of comono-mers (o10 wt%) would not significantly affect the properties of the block copolymers such as Tg, polarity, mechanical proper-ties, etc. Conducting RAFT polymerization via emulsion polymeriza-tion in a semi-continuous process has also been proposed to circumvent the issue of the monomer addition order. As pre-sented in Section 3.4, the idea of this concept is based on the reduction of the monomer concentration at the polymerization locus, allowing for the addition of fewer monomer units afterThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3455each cycle of addition/fragmentation during the RAFT process. Inspired by this concept, Moad and coworkers49,84,120 reported in the early 2000’s an elegant strategy on the preparation of multiblock copolymers via ‘‘sulfur free RAFT’’ emulsion poly-merization. This strategy consists of the preparation of an macromonomer end-functionalized with methacrylate groups (block A) which can be further reactivated for the polymeriza-tion of monomer B, generating the AB block copolymer. Main-taining very low concentrations of monomer B through the use of a starved monomer feed has the consequence that when the undesirable ‘‘backward’’ fragmentation occurs, there is less ‘‘punishment’’ in the sense that fewer B units are added than would otherwise be the case. Eventually, ‘‘forward’’ fragmentation occurs, and the chain extension of Block A with B is then achieved. This can be accomplished by conducting the polymer-ization as a semi-continuous process where the feeding rate of the monomer can be adjusted to minimize its accumulation in the system – i.e. the feeding rate is similar to the rate of monomer consumption, resulting in starve-fed conditions. Hence, a well-defined methacrylate-based heptablock multiblock copolymer (Fig. 7A) was successfully synthesized in a one-pot process. Recently, Engelis et al.87,165 further expanded this concept through investigating the preparation of methacrylate-basedmultiblock copolymers via ‘‘sulfur-free RAFT’’ emulsion poly-merization in starved-fed conditions. Sophisticated high-order multiblock copolymers (up to 21 blocks) were obtained using a one-pot process, with full conversions after each polymeri-zation cycle (498%) resulting in low dispersity polymers (Ð = 1.20–1.35). An undecablock multiblock copolymer using four dif-ferent methacrylates, altering the monomer sequence and compo-sition, was successfully prepared as indicated by the clear MWD shift towards a higher MW after each polymerization cycle (Fig. 7D). Although excellent control over the architecture, the molecular weight and composition were obtained in these systems, and the lack of versatility is an intrinsic limitation of the method given that the process is restricted to methacrylates. Based on these two concepts: (i) use of comonomers and (ii) low monomer concentrations at the polymerization locus, a detailed investigation was carried out regarding the use of comonomers on the synthesis of multiblocks via RAFT emul-sion polymerization. Multiblock copolymers comprising alter-nating PBMA and PSt blocks were synthesized in a comparative study either in the presence or the absence of comonomers (10 wt% St) via solution, miniemulsion and emulsion polymer-ization (Fig. 9).119 As expected, the successful chain extension of PBMA with St was obtained during the synthesis of a3456 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023PBMA200-b-PSt200-PBMA180-stat-PSt20 triblock copolymer (shift of MWDs from the 1st block to the 2nd block, Fig. 9C and D) – given that methacryloyl radicals are better leaving radicals than styrene-based ones.212 However, for the next block extension with BMA (3rd block, Fig. 9C and D), the addition of St as a comonomer was crucial in the successful formation of the well-defined triblock copolymer. A PBMA200-b-PMMA100-b-PSt100-b-(PMMA90-stat-PSt10)-b-PSt100 pentablock was then synthesized to solidify the concept. It is worth noting that the addition of the comonomer could not solely circumvent the limitation of the monomer addition order in solution and miniemulsion (Fig. 9B, D and F), demonstrating that the in-built monomer feed mecha-nism in emulsion polymerization (i.e. the monomer diffusing from monomer droplets to polymer particles) also played a crucial role in the successful formation of a well-defined multiblock copolymer regardless of the monomer order.41,119 In conclusion, the synergis-tic effect of the use of the comonomer alongside conducting RAFT in emulsion polymerization has proved to be a successful strategy for the preparation of high-order multiblock copolymers, and has since been further employed successfully in various systems (Fig. 7B, C, D, E, F and 9D).109,110,1664.2. Radical penetration As the complexity and scope of multiblock copolymers able to be synthesized increases, new challenges arise. The synthesis of well controlled, high molecular weight multiblock copolymers is relatively new to RAFT, though a necessary endeavor for many practical applications, especially when considering phase separation and mechanical properties.144,218 As previously mentioned, the compartmentalization effect characteristic of emulsion polymerization has allowed a process traditionally more suited for the synthesis of oligomers to achieve the synthesis of multiblock copolymers with high molecular weights (4100 000 g molNone1).40 As the polymer molecular weight and thus particle size increases in emulsion polymerization systems, the rate of radical diffusion through particles becomes a significant point of concern.142 In systems where the RAFT agent Z-group is located towards the particle core, such as where a stabilizing macroRAFT is involved, radical oligomers generated in the continuous phase (z-mers) should ideally penetrate and subsequently diffuse swiftly through polymer particles to avoid termination events and to ensure that not too many monomer additions occur before the RAFT chain transfer step.142 However, there are a number of factors that significantly affect the rate of radical diffusion, including but not limited to Tg of the seed and subsequent polymer blocks, the extent of monomer swelling of particles, polymerization temperature, crosslinking, and monomer conversion; such factors can be generalized to the ‘hardness’ of a given polymer particle.142,158,219–222 It has been demonstrated by Sundberg and coworkers that frustrated radical diffusion in non-living seeded emulsion polymerizations begets particle morphologies tending towards core–shell, as propagating chains experience termination events throughout the particle surface region.223 In the corresponding RAFT systems, such terminated polymer is not under RAFT control, with chain extension subsequentlyceasing and ever broader dispersities becoming apparent.142 The exact morphology produced in a seeded emulsion system can be more precisely determined by considering a number of factors including Tg, the extent of phase separation, interfacial tension at the particle/water interface, etc.158,224 Polymer particles containing high Tg polymers such as poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) PtBMA and PSt reduce chain mobi-lity and are thus expected to be particularly susceptible to issues with radical penetration. This was supported by the recent work on the synthesis of undecablock model homopo-lymers (i.e. successive blocks of the same monomer) using PBMA, poly(iso-butyl methacrylate) (PiBMA) and PtBMA (Tg = 20 1C, 57 1C and 118 1C respectively), where a trend linking higher Tg to higher dispersity was observed (Fig. 10). 142 The Tg of PtBMA is above the polymerization temperature (80 1C); the high dispersities and broad MWDs seen in Fig. 10C can thus be attributed to the failure of propagating radicals to penetrate through to the RAFT moiety before undergoing uncontrolled polymerization at various depths and on the surface of the polymer particles, as well as too many monomer units being added prior to propagating radicals undergoing RAFT exchange. MWD broadening and higher dispersities were still observed in the PiBMA system (Fig. 10B) compared to the lower Tg PBMA (Fig. 10A), implying that high MW polymers with Tg values below the polymerization temperature can still be affected by radical penetration. Lower MW polymers (%xn o 100) generally avoid such issues entirely, even when the poly-mer Tg exceeds the polymerization temperature. 158,222 Artificial plasticization of particles, whether by a monomer or a swelling agent such as toluene, has been demonstrated to enhance the radical penetration of high Tg polymers and thus beget narrower MWDs.142,144,223 However, high dispersity values are still observed in these cases.",
        "4.3. Nature of the initiator The use of oil-soluble initiators has been proposed as a method of overcoming issues with radical penetration. Indeed, it was demonstrated by Zetterlund’s group that for the seeded emulsion polymerization of high Tg PtBMA undecablock copolymers, using initiators of increasing hydrophobicity (potassium persulfate (KPS) o 4,40-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid) (ACPA) o azobisiso-butyronitrile (AIBN) o benzoyl peroxide (BPO) with water solubi-lities of 52, 2.75, 0.35 and 9.10 None 10None3 g LNone1 respectively) resulted in multiblock copolymers with narrower MWDs, clearer block shifting and a decreasing prevalence of high MW shoulders (Fig. 11).225 The effect was significantly reduced yet still noticeable for equivalent polymerizations using the lower Tg PBMA. While the initiation mechanism of water-soluble initiators in emulsion has been studied extensively and is well understood,22,158 there remains a degree of obscurity around the exact mechanisms regarding oil-soluble initiators in equivalent systems.226 This is perhaps a contributing factor to its state as a rarity for use in emulsion and seeded emulsion polymerization systems, with limited applications being seen in reducing homogenous nucleation,227–230 improving colloidal stability,231,232 and achiev-ing particular morphologies.233,234This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3457Two main schools of thought regarding the exact nature of oil-soluble initiation in emulsion have been proposed, with differences concerning whether single radicals are sourced from the (i) aqueous phase235–238 or (ii) oil phase.227,239–241 Proposal (i) considers a strict application of Smith–Ewart 0–1 kinetics, with the result being an annihilation of geminate oil-phase radical pairs via bimolecular termination; instead, trace concentrations of oil-soluble initiators in the aqueous phase contribute to initiation through a similar mechanism to water-soluble initiators. Proposal (ii) suggests that the radical exit from particles is competitive with bimolecular termination, with a single radical being left behind and the exiting radical free to terminate or re-enter an alternate particle. It has also been suggested specifically for RAFT mediated systems that radical activity can be transferred to a dormant chain, increas-ing the instance of two radicals inhabiting a single particle.242 The significant difference between the MWDs of KPS and BPO initiated systems highlights the clear role of the mitigation of radical penetration and lends credence to proposal (ii); oil-sourced radicals forgo the need to penetrate the water/particle interface and require a lesser diffusion distance to encounter the RAFT moiety. It should however also be noted that the use of more hydrophobic initiators also resulted in decreased reaction rates. This was attributed to the cage effect; given the oil-soluble initiator is situated within polymer particles, upon decomposition there is a very real possibility that bimo-lecular termination occurs as per Smith–Ewart’s 0–1 kinetics, highlighted in proposal (i).243 While somewhat allayed both byprocesses leading to the radical exit244 and transferal of radical activity to dormant chains as per the RAFT mechanism,242 the contribution of the cage effect remains a significant factor, especially when polymerizing low kp monomers. Higher initia-tor concentrations may thus be necessary to overcome this effect.",
        "5. Morphology 5.1. Microphase separation of block copolymers One of the most intriguing properties of multiblock copolymers obtained in dispersed media is their microphase separation within the particles. The microphase separation of block copo-lymers in bulk is a well-established field which has attracted significant interest in a wide variety of spheres, including nanotechnology, microelectronics, and nanofabrication. Most applications to date focus on thin films of diblock copolymers to produce patterned surfaces as templates for nanofabrication applications, including nanoporous films, lithographic masks, photonic materials, nanoparticle production and high-density magnetic devices.245–247 Such a wide range of applications arises from the versatility of the polymer design in terms of size, structure, composition, and the variety of ordered nano-domains obtained by self-assembly. The emergence of novel economical and simple synthetic routes for the synthesis of block copolymers has also precipitated the development of applications through the production of extensive arrays of3458 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023materials exhibiting superior mechanical properties when com-pared to the existing polymeric materials.",
        "If the blocks of a block copolymer are incompatible, spon-taneous self-assembly occurs in nanodomains. Annealing of the resulting materials, typically using temperature or solvent vapours, leads to ordered microphase morphologies, whose size can range from tens to hundreds of nanometers. The morphologies are typically governed by both the enthalpic gain of demixing of the constituent blocks and the entropic cost of chain confinement within the domains. The microphase mor-phology is determined by the constituent block volume fraction (f), alongside both the overall degree of polymerization (N), and the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (w), which when combined, make up the degree of incompatibility (wN). For instance, in the simple example of an AB diblock copolymer, wAB is a dimensionless interaction parameter, which expresseswhere dA and dB represent molar volumes of polymers A and B, respectively, dA and dB are the solubility parameters of A and B, respectively, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Under the condition wN r 10.5, the system is governed by entropic terms, leading to a disordered phase. In the case wN 4 10.5, enthalpic terms dominate, resulting in an order– disordered transition (ODT), where A and B blocks phase separate into the ordered microstructures.218,249 For incompa-tible AB diblock copolymers, an evolution of the microphase separation morphology can be observed, namely a progressionThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3459of lamellae (volume fraction fA E 0.35–0.69) to hexagonally packed cylinders of B in a matrix of A ( fA E 0.10 None 0.35 and 0.69 None 0.90), to spheres of B in a matrix of A ( fA r 0.1 and Z 0.90), see Fig. 12.218 It should be noted that the phase diagram boundaries become significantly less well defined at lower wN values. More complicated nanostructures, such as perforated lamellae and gyroid structures, although suggested as meta-stable, are also accessible on the condition that the composi-tion of the copolymer lies between lamellar and cylindrical morphologies within a narrow range.",
        "The number and types of morphologies also increase signifi-cantly when additional blocks are added in multiblock copolymers.1 The microphase behaviour of triblock copolymers displays an additional layer of complexity when compared to diblock copolymers, and is determined by the individual block weight fraction (fA + fB + fC = 1), the total degree of polymerization (NABC), and also the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters between each segment, i.e. wAB, wBC and wAC. Structural factors including polymer chain topology and the sequence of component blocks (ABC, ACB, CBA, and CAB) also have a significant influence over microphase separation. This leads to a wider range of acces-sible morphologies, including but not limited to lamella–lamellae, lamella–cylinders, lamella–spheres, cylinders–in-lamellae, core/ shell cylinders, triple/quadruple cylinder-on-cylinders, perforatedcircular lamella-on-cylinders, double/triple helices-on-cylinders, knitting pattern, core/shell double gyroid, etc.251 For instance, Fig. 13 illustrates the range of morphologies expected from the triblock copolymer PSt-b-PBd-b-PtBMA (Bd = butadiene).252 Increasing the number of blocks further affects relevant parameters, leading to a wide spectrum of factors to consider. The effect of block dispersity for instance becomes a complex parameter to predict, making modelling and therefore mor-phology prediction very difficult, only possible through gui-dance from the characterisation of pre-synthesised structures. Advanced characterisation techniques thus become key players in the design process of materials based on microphase separa-tion. How various parameters influence each other should also be taken into consideration. Increasing the number of blocks whilst reducing their degree of polymerization in systems that would typically show microphase separation, e.g. polystyrene/ polyisoprene multiblock copolymers253 or poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate)/poly(tert-butyl acrylate),254 leads to a system which behaves more like a statistical copolymer (no phase separation) than a block copolymer. The role of the interface between the polymeric material and the outer system – highly relevant to emulsion polymerization since the interface is always with a non-solvent, typically water – can also affect morphology. Such phenomena have been mostly3460 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023studied in the case of thin films of block copolymers, where each constituent block’s wetting properties at both the surface of the substrate and the air/film interface affect microphase separation.246,255 For instance, for copolymers forming lamel-lae morpohologies parallel to the substrate, a multi-layered structure is generated, with the thickness of the film being a multiple of the lamellar period, L0. In the case of symmetric wetting, where the blocks have an affinity to both the air and substrate interfaces, the resultant film is continuous and smooth given its thickness is t = nL0, with n being an integer (Fig. 14A). However, in the case of asymmetric wetting, where one block has more affinity for the substrate and the other block for the air interface, a smooth film can only be obtainedfor the film thickness t = (n + 1/2) L0 (Fig. 14B). In cases where the prepared film has a thickness that is not a multiple of L0, the formation of holes or islands with a height L0 becomes apparent (Fig. 14C). The hole/island morphology has been examined in a number of systems, including those forming lamellar domains, and also for cylinder-forming256,257 and sphere-forming systems.258,259 To date, most studies of block copolymer self-assembly have focused on systems where blocks are both segregated to a significant extent owing to their distinct chemical structures, and monodisperse in the chain length, to ensure a high degree of ordering.260 However more recently, experiments261,262 and theoretical studies260 have demonstrated that well-orderedThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3461morphologies may also be accessed in block copolymer systems obtained with (narrow) polydispersity by more versatile syn-thetic techniques such as radical-based polymerisations (e.g. RAFT polymerisation). These observations have opened the path to a wider range of applications, since these synthetic techniques are more scaleable and more versatile for the manufacturing industry.",
        "A notable example is the work by Luo and coworkers, who utilised seeded RAFT emulsion polymerization to synthesise high molecular weight octablock copolymers.263 High degrees of polymerization (4100) were targeted to observe microphase separation between low w systems such as PSt-b-PBA. During styrene chain extensions, a small percentage of toluene (8 wt% to styrene) was introduced to act as a plasticizer to improve the monomer conversion (from 96 to over 98%). This ensured efficient chain extension at each stage of the ‘one-pot’ octablock (8 blocks) synthesis. Following solvent casting (which of course destroys any morphology of the original latex nanoparticles), the resulting multiblock copolymer films showed clear micro-phase separation behaviour as lamellar morphologies (with periods around 40–50 nm) observed via AFM, even for multi-blocks with low w values such as (PSt-b-PBA)m with m = 1–4. Moreover, the number of blocks was shown to affect thermal and mechanical properties – the increasing block number led to both an increase in the glass transition temperature and tensile strength.",
        "Further studies by Luo and coworkers explored in detail the effect of the block architecture on the mechanical properties of the respective multiblocks. A systematic library of hard (PSt domains) and soft (PBA domains) multiblock copolymers wassynthesised.148 Interestingly, an increase in the block number led to an enhancement in the tensile strength and toughness of the material, but no significant changes to the modulus were observed. This combination of soft, strong and tough elasto-meric behaviour has great potential applications in soft robotics and wearable/stretchable electronics.",
        "5.2. Particle morphology (multi-layered particles) In the field of nanoparticles, the self-assembly of block copo-lymers has led to a plethora of novel morphologies.106,110,264–270 The ability to tailor nanoparticle morphology comes from an understanding of how polymers interact with one another and their solvent environment. In solution, the nanoparticle for-mation of block copolymers occurs spontaneously when one block is solvophobic and another is solvophilic. The simplest example is the assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers. In the presence of water, such polymer phase separates to form a hydrophobic core and highly solvated hydrophilic corona. The block copolymer phase behaviour is influenced by the compo-sition, confinement, surface area and solvent exposure (i.e., the interfacial free energy), all of which alter the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviours of the self-assembled system, and in turn dictate the nanoparticle morphology.271–273 Moreover, the extensive literature on polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA)106,274,275 highlights the ease with which a range of higher-order morphologies can be accessed.276 It is also worth noting the importance of understanding key parameters during polymerization (i.e., the choice of macroCTA, monomer, temperature, concentration, etc.) that affect the resulting morphology.106,274 The self-assembly of diblock copolymers, which has been widely examined, will not be covered in this review.104,131,277,278 Importantly, when moving from diblock to multiblock copolymer assemblies in solution, the mixing and phase separation behaviour increases in complexity.11 The phase separation of multiblock copolymers has been a key for realising increasingly complex morphologies such as multi-layered nanoparticles. An early example by Wooley and coworkers used triblock copolymers to yield multi-layered particles that could form kinetically trapped or covalently crosslinked toroidal (or ring-like) assemblies.279 Groschel et al. reported the precise hierarchical self-assembly of micelles made up of multiple compartments using linear ABC triblock terpolymers.280 Importantly, all these systems are assembled using a solvent exchange process. The polymer is first fully dissolved (all blocks solvated), followed by self-assembly trig-gered by the slow addition of a non-solvent (a solvent whereby the polymer or, in this case a certain ‘block’, is solvophobic). Connal et al. reported that such a solvent assembly process could also be combined with metal coordination to yield hybrid mesostructured block copolymer nanoparticles.281 This was achieved using a solvent exchange strategy referred to as the solvent-absorbing/releasing method (SARM).269,282 Howdle and coworkers reported the use of RAFT dispersion polymerization to generate triblock copolymers (PMMA-b-PSt-b-P4VP) in supercritical CO2. 283 TEM images revealed that PMMA-b-PSt diblock copolymers could adopt a lamellar morphology,3462 | Chem.

Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023and that the addition of the P4VP block could lead to the formation of distinct spherical domains in the lamellar sheets through microparticle confinement. This morphology is less pronounced at the particle core due to the increased spherical constraint at the centre of these microstructures. These micro-domains formed within the particle were then used as a template to form hollow TiO2 microparticles.",
        "RAFT emulsion polymerization has been used to nano-engineer multiblock copolymer particles. Guimaraes et al. reported using macroRAFT-assisted emulsion polymerization to yield high-order multi-layered nanoparticles.109 The amphiphilic diblock copolymer poly(acrylic acid)-b-polystyrene (PAA24-b-PSt8-TTC) was first synthe-sised and then used to prepare polystyrene seed particles via ab initio emulsion polymerization as outlined in Section 4. Subse-quently, sequential seeded emulsion polymerizations were per-formed to generate a pentablock copolymer comprising alter-nating blocks of polystyrene and poly(butyl methacrylate). Ultrathin cross-sectional TEM imaging of the nanoparticles immobilised in epoxy resin revealed the expected multi-layered ‘onion-like’ particle morphologies (Fig. 15).",
        "Following this work, Khan et al. further demonstrated the versatility of this method by synthesising multicompositional ‘onion-like’ nanoparticles.110 The amphiphilic macroRAFT agent PMAA-b-PMMA-TTC was used to generate the seed parti-cles using ab initio emulsion polymerization. A range of poly-methacrylate (BMA, BzMA, and tBMA) blocks with various Tgs were incorporated into different multiblock copolymers. Phase separation within the nanoparticles was observed using ultra-thin cross-sectional TEM. Though TEM imaging clearly shows the formation of multi-layered ‘onion-like’ nanoparticles, it is worth noting specific challenges associated with TEM imaging as outlined by the authors. These works clearly demonstrate that how RAFT emulsion polymerization can be employed to generate multi-layered polymer nanoparticles of very specific morphology. It is of note that the microphase separation that occurs within the particles is not only merely dictated by the theoretical framework outlined in Section 4 based on wN, but also influenced by the way the polymer chains are orientated within the particles due to being anchored at the oil–water interphase via the hydrophilic R-group, and with the Z-groupbeing located towards the core region of the particle. In fact, one can envisage that microphase separation under such con-ditions would occur even if the corresponding bulk material system did not undergo microphase separation based on pre-dictions using wN. In the case of the aforementioned PBMA-b-PSt pentablock system,109 the relevant value of wN (o 3.6)110 leads one to expect microphase separation to not occur, in contrast to what is clearly demonstrated via TEM imaging (Fig. 15). Unlike multilayered nanoparticles produced through SARM,110 which are limited to di-or triblock copolymers (AB and ABA-type blocks), the use of sequential monomer addition during emulsion polymerization allows for the generation of multicomponent layered nanoparticles in the sense that each polymer layer can in principle be tailored at will regarding the composition, layer thickness and the order of layers (within the constraints of what is possible from a RAFT emulsion polymerization perspective, of course). Overall, these examples further highlight how compartmentalization in RAFT emulsion polymerization can be a powerful tool to improve polymer control and realise complex multi-layered nanoparticles.",
        "6. Conclusions and future perspectives Multiblock copolymers offer seemingly endless opportunities in terms of design of new advanced polymeric materials and polymeric nanoparticles. The control over the distribution of monomer units along a polymer chain with the precision seen in biopolymers found in nature, such as nucleic acids and proteins, remains a longstanding quest of polymer chemists. Multiblock copolymers can be considered as representing a step towards the ultimately desired control over the placement of each individual monomer unit. In theory, the types of multiblock copolymers that can be designed and experimen-tally prepared are virtually endless. However, in practice, var-ious constraints exist due to limitations and shortcomings of currently available synthetic methodologies. Copolymers com-prising two or three blocks have been prepared by RDRP and studied rather extensively over many years, but it is only overThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3438–3469 |3463the past decade or so that advances in RDRP have enabled the synthesis of a range of multiblock copolymers comprising an excess of three blocks.",
        "The present review has focused on the use of RAFT poly-merization implemented in aqueous emulsion polymerization for the synthesis of multiblock copolymers. This approach offers a range of advantages, both in terms of significantly expanding the range of multiblock copolymer types that are experimentally accessible, and providing access to interesting nanoparticle morphologies (most notably multilayered parti-cles). The use of RAFT emulsion polymerization allows one to benefit from effects of compartmentalization (the nanoreactor concept), which leads to an increase in the polymerization rate, thereby enabling the synthesis of multiblock copolymers of monomers with low propagation rate coefficients as well as accessing high molecular weight blocks. In this way, the use of emulsion polymerization can provide access to various bio-based monomers which often have intrinsically low polymeri-zation rates. Moreover, constraints in terms of the order of blocks of specific monomers can be significantly relaxed, thereby further expanding the library of accessible multiblock copolymer structures. Considering that one fascinating aspect of multiblock copolymers is how self-assembly in the form of microphase separation into discrete nano-sized domains pro-vides the material morphology control on length scales ranging from a few nanometers to a micrometer, it is paramount that the types of multiblock copolymers available to scientists are not overly restricted by synthetic limitations. Microphase sepa-rated polymeric materials that comprise polymer segments of distinct properties largely dictate the potential applications of multiblock copolymers. In regard to the polymer particle morphology control, there are opportunities in advanced par-ticle design both in terms of the polymer (and thus particle) composition and understanding of how particles with such intricate morphologies behave for example in paint and coat-ings applications, not to mention more high-tech applications such as drug delivery. Emulsion polymerization technologies are particularly well suited for industrial applications, given that current industrial set ups for such a well-established polymer synthesis protocol can be readily adapted for multi-block copolymer synthesis via RAFT emulsion polymerization.",
        "The synthetic capabilities in the field of multiblock copoly-mers, beyond RDRP and with other methodologies, have expanded significantly over the last decade. In order for these exciting materials to fulfill their potential, it is imperative that polymer chemists interact with physicists and material scien-tists to maximize the impact of these materials of the future. One of the features of RDRP is its simple setup, which makes it an approachable technique to non-experts, facilitating interdisciplinary work. Interdisciplinary collaboration will cre-ate a feedback loop whereby new advanced materials can be designed based on non-empirical and less trial-and-error based approaches. For example, it is currently not generally well understood to what extent the multiblock copolymer structure (e.g. block order) plays a crucial role in materials properties. Another significant area of opportunity is represented byautomated high throughput synthesis, possibly even coupled with machine learning (artificial intelligence) to elucidate the complex structure–property relationship. Overall, the area of multiblock copolymers remains a field of immense future opportunities in advanced materials design.",
