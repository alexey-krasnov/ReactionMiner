For these radical addition reactions, protonation site variations drive significant changes in nearby radical reactivity, and this is primarily due to through-space electrostatic effects. Furthermore, quantum chemical methods specifically designed for calculating long-range interactions, such as double-hybrid density functional theory, are required to rationalize the experimentally measured difference in reactivity. Recent studies have shown that orientated electric fields(OEFs) can catalyze reactions1-7 and shift electronic excited states8-10 by (de)stabilizing key transition states.5,11,12 At the surface of water microdroplets, the electrochemical reduction of organic molecules has been rationalized by high proton concentrations.13,14 However, since electrostatic effects are highly directional, external OEFs are a challenge to harness for many chemical systems since untethered molecules are typically unaligned in bulk solution. The inclusion of internal charged-moieties in the form of protonated/deprotonated functional groups, hypervalent groups and noncovalently bound ions (e.g., metal ions) can overcome this problem by fixing the position and distance of a charge near/on a molecule.15 This establishes a fixed internal OEF to be exploited for chemical and photochemical reactivity. In the case of protonation, the site of protonation on a molecule influences photofragmentation distributions, photo-isomerization rates, excited-state lifetimes, and spectroscopic profiles.16-21 For radical ions, through-space charge effects have been shown to alter the reactivity of gas-phase reactions by several orders of magnitude.22-24 Additionally, deprotona-tion can have unexpected consequences on radical reactivity. For example, HOMO-SOMO inversion for deprotonated anion radical ions drastically affects the stability of the radical site.25,26 Techniques have been developed to generate radical ions with specific OEFs;27-29 however, there is still much to discover about how OEFs influence the reactivity of radicals. In particular, bespoke experimental methods are needed to accurately measure these effects and benchmark the computa-tional methodology. Motivated by the need to develop new experimental protocols, this study targets the internal electrostatic effects of an ion-radical pair by measuring the protonation-specific reactions of the 1,3-diazanaphthalene radical cation protomers. First by proving these two protonation isomers can be separated with ion mobility filtering and then probing the reactivity of these species using ion trap kinetics. The electric field at the radical site generated by protonation is significantly different for these two isomers, 215 and 7 A.U., calculated using TITAN;30 however, these radicals have essentially indistinguishable proton affinities31 and, as shown below, conventional computational methods are not sufficient to predict the measured relative rates of reaction. The reaction with ethylene is a prototype system for aromatic radical addition to a double bond. Using the combined methods of ion mobility and ion trap mass spectrometry with ion-molecular reactions, we benchmarked the accuracy of several computa-tional methods for predicting the outcomes of these electro-static effects. The workflow of this experiment is shown in Figure 1. Brominated diazanaphthalene precursors, dissolved in meth-anol, are protonated and liberated into the gas-phase by electrospray ionization. The ions pass through field asymmetric ion mobility separation (FAIMS)32,33 before isolation and storage in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The FAIMS filters and separates the two protonation isomer populations, as confirmed by UVPD action spectroscopy (shown below). After FAIMS selection, a laser pulse induces homolysis of the Br-C bond to generate the 8-dehydroquinazolineH+ distonic radical ion where the protonated site is retained on either the 3-nitrogen or the 1-nitrogen. These distonic radical ions are then stored and allowed to react with ethylene in an ion trap to record the kinetics. For comparison, similar measurements are also reported for 5-dehydroisoquinolinium and 8-dehydroqui-nolinium, which have unambiguous protonation sites, each analogous to one of the diazanaphthalene protomers (Figure 2). The FAIMS ionogram of 8-bromoquinazolinium (m/z 209, isotope 79Br) is shown in Figure 3A and contains two broad peaks each centered at compensation voltage (CV) values of -3.5 V and +0.5 V.

UVPD of 8-bromoquinazolinium gives rise to photoproducts at m/z 182, 130, 129, 103, and 76. All reported photodissociation action spectra here track the m/z 130 photofragment (arising from 79Br loss). The action spectrum of ions selected at either FAIMS CV -4 and +1 V are shown in Figure 3B and C, respectively, and there are several broad features over this range. Importantly, the CV -4 V action spectra contains a feature around 420 nm (×200 magnified, labeled I), which is absent in the CV 1 V action spectrum. At higher energies, another feature is observed around 260 nm at CV -4 V (labeled II), which is also absent in the CV +1 V spectrum. These spectra are compared to Franck-Condon (FC) CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ TD-DFT simulations,34-36 which have been red-shifted by 2000 cm-1.37 Features I and II match simulated FC transitions of 3-N protonated 8-dehydroquina-zolinium (shaded areas in Figure 3B). These transitions are absent in the FC simulation of the 1-N protomer. Based on the absence of these features, as well as the general agreement between the FC simulation and the experimental spectrum, the ion population selected using + 1 V is assigned as the 1-N protomer, and the CV -4 V population is assigned to the 3-N protomer. However, the presence of a minor population of 1-N protonated 8-dehydroquinazolium in Figure 3B cannot be definitively ruled out because feature III overlaps with feature IV in Figure 3C. These assignments are consistent with a previous study on the FAIMS separation of protonated quinazoline, which assigned the lower CV peak as the 3-N protonation site and the higher CV peak as 1-N protonation.31 Once introduced into the ion trap and irradiated with a single laser pulse, photodissociation of brominated precursor [M-Br]+ forms a corresponding radical cation from Br loss (Figure 1). No isomerization is expected following PD due to the high transition state barriers with the available excess energy following C-Br bond homolysis (further details are provided in the Supporting Information). This is further supported by kinetic measurements (vide inf ra). The target radicals react with ethylene to form adducts [M + 28]+ at either m/z 157 (R3 and R4) or m/z 158 (R1 and R2). Only R3 exhibits a prominent H-atom-loss product (m/z 156). Potential energy schemes for these reactions are provided in the Supporting Information. Product mass spectra for each reaction were recorded, and ion signals are plotted as a function of reaction time in Figure 4A-D. These kinetic experiments were repeated across six ethylene concentrations, and the second-order rate coefficient for each reaction was calculated by plotting pseudo-first-order rate coefficients, extracted from these profiles, against the ethylene concen-tration within the ion trap as discussed in section I of the Supporting Information. These pseudo-first-order plots were fitted by linear regression and are plotted in Figure 4E, F. Reaction efficiencies were calculated by normalizing second-order rate coefficients to the Langevin collision rate (ethylene is a neutral molecule with no permanent dipole moment).38 Branching ratios are given in Table S1 and reaction efficiencies and second-order rate constants are listed in Table 1. The most efficient reaction is R1 (42%), followed by R2 (20%), R3 (8.2%), and R4 (1.4%). Importantly, without FAIMS separation, distinct measurements for R1 and R2 would not be straightforward. For both quinazoline-and quinoline-based radical cations, the fastest reaction occurs when the proton is closest to the radical site. Additionally, the two quinazoline based radical cations are significantly faster than their quinoline counterparts, indicating that the electron lone pair on the nitrogen accelerates the reaction. For ion-molecule distonic radical reactions, it is previously observed for 18 different reactions that the energy of the prereactive complex (PRC) has no correlation with the rate of the reaction.24,39 Instead it is the stability of a long-range PRC transition state that primarily controls the reaction rate. This transition state energy has been used to predict the reactivity of similar distonic radicals, although this parameter is sensitive and requires careful calculation and benchmarking. This means that small changes in the transition state energy will have large impacts on the predicted reaction rate. For the two protonation-isomer reactions, the optimized transition states are shown in Figure 5. Using G3X-K, a high-level composite method,40 these transition state energies do not align with the experimental reaction efficiency trend (Table 1). R2 has the lowest calculated transition state energy (-19 kJ/mol) and is therefore expected to be the fastest reaction, but the experimental results instead show that R1 (-18 kJ/mol barrier) has over double the reaction efficiency. This transition state energy difference, however, is within the mean error of this method: ±2 kJ/mol.41 To improve the treatment of these transition states each stationary point was recalculated using DSD-PBEP86/aug-cc-pVTZ � a double hybrid method better suited to model long-range electronic effects.40 Using DSD-PBEP86 the four barrier heights are in the order of the measured reaction efficiency, ascending from R1 (-20 kJ/mol, 42%) to R2 (-18 kJ/mol, 20%) to R3 (-15 kJ/mol, 8.2%) and to R4 (-13 kJ/mol, 1.4%). The differences in these values lie outside the expected mean error of these calculations (±0.4 kJ/mol)42 so this interpretation of these results is reasonable. This highlights the importance of double-hybrid methods for systems affected by long-range forces. Reaction efficiencies of similar ion-molecule reactions have been shown to generally correlate with the electron affinity of the radical cation.22,45,46 Adiabatic electron affinities for the current systems were calculated using M06-2X/6-31G-(2df,p)47,48 and are listed in Table 1. Adiabatic electron affinities for a range of other methods are provided in the Supporting Information. However, again, this does not reproduce the ordering of the experiment and serves as a caution for using electron affinities alone as a predictive parameter. To substantiate the through-space influence on the energy of these rate-limiting transition states, the difference in TS1 energy between R1 and R2 was partitioned into correlation, exchange, and Hartree components (calculated using DSD-PBEP8640) following the analysis of Gryn’ova and Coote.49 These values are summarized in Table 2. For this analysis, a negative value corresponds to a component more stabilized for R1 and a positive value corresponds to a component more stabilized for R2. A through-space electrostatic effect will manifest as a difference in the Hartree energy.49 Thus, the negative Hartree energy (-11 kJ/mol) in Table 2 reveals that the through-space electrostatic interaction is more favorable for R1 than that for R2. In contrast, the positive exchange-energy indicates that stabilization via electron delocalization is more favorable for R2, most likely due to the closer range lone-pair interaction with ethylene. The Hartree energy is the dominant component that preferentially stabilizes TS1 for R1 and it follows that the increased rate of reaction for R1 primarily derives from stronger through-space electrostatic stabilization due to the closer protonation site. In summary, these results show that differences in protonation site can dictate nearby radical reactivity, as rationalized by through-space oriented electric field consid-erations. The experimentally measured rates of reaction are significantly slower (5-20 times) for the quinoline radical cations, indicating that along with the effects of charge location, the nearby electron lone pair on the nitrogen accelerates the reaction for the two quinazoline protomers. These reaction rates correlate to the stability of the calculated long-range prereactive transition state. Importantly, due to the small energy differences between the transition states of these molecules, among the tested methods, only the double hybrid method (DSD-PBEP86) could reproduce the experimental reactivity trend. This method can be applied to any radical-ion reaction if suitable halogenated precursors can be separated with ion filtering techniques.

        "studies have shown that orientated electric fields(OEFs) can catalyze reactions1-7 and shift electronicexcited states8-10 by (de)stabilizing key transition states.5,11,12 At the surface of water microdroplets, the electrochemical reduction of organic molecules has been rationalized by high proton concentrations.13,14 However, since electrostatic effects are highly directional, external OEFs are a challenge to harness for many chemical systems since untethered molecules are typically unaligned in bulk solution. The inclusion of internal charged-moieties in the form of protonated/deprotonated functional groups, hypervalent groups and noncovalently bound ions (e.g., metal ions) can overcome this problem by fixing the position and distance of a charge near/on a molecule.15 This establishes a fixed internal OEF to be exploited for chemical and photochemical reactivity.",
        "In the case of protonation, the site of protonation on a molecule influences photofragmentation distributions, photo-isomerization rates, excited-state lifetimes, and spectroscopic profiles.16-21 For radical ions, through-space charge effects have been shown to alter the reactivity of gas-phase reactions by several orders of magnitude.22-24 Additionally, deprotona-tion can have unexpected consequences on radical reactivity. For example, HOMO-SOMO inversion for deprotonated anion radical ions drastically affects the stability of the radical site.25,26 Techniques have been developed to generate radical ions with specific OEFs;27-29 however, there is still much to discover about how OEFs influence the reactivity of radicals. In particular, bespoke experimental methods are needed to accurately measure these effects and benchmark the computa-tional methodology.",
        "Motivated by the need to develop new experimental protocols, this study targets the internal electrostatic effects of an ion-radical pair by measuring the protonation-specific reactions of the 1,3-diazanaphthalene radical cation protomers. First by proving these two protonation isomers can be separated with ion mobility filtering and then probing the reactivity of these species using ion trap kinetics. The electric field at the radical site generated by protonation is significantly different for these two isomers, 215 and 7 A.U., calculated using TITAN;30 however, these radicals have essentially indistinguishable proton affinities31 and, as shown below, conventional computational methods are not sufficient to predict the measured relative rates of reaction. The reaction with ethylene is a prototype system for aromatic radical addition to a double bond. Using the combined methods of ion mobility and ion trap mass spectrometry with ion-molecular reactions, we benchmarked the accuracy of several computa-tional methods for predicting the outcomes of these electro-static effects.",
        "The workflow of this experiment is shown in Figure 1. Brominated diazanaphthalene precursors, dissolved in meth-anol, are protonated and liberated into the gas-phase by electrospray ionization. The ions pass through field asymmetric ion mobility separation (FAIMS)32,33 before isolation and storage in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The FAIMS filters and separates the two protonation isomer populations, as confirmed by UVPD action spectroscopy (shown below). After FAIMS selection, a laser pulse induces homolysis of the Br-C bond to generate the 8-dehydroquinazolineH+ distonic radical ion where the protonated site is retained on either the 3-nitrogen or the 1-nitrogen. These distonic radical ions are then stored and allowed to react with ethylene in an ion trap to record the kinetics. For comparison, similar measurements are also reported for 5-dehydroisoquinolinium and 8-dehydroqui-nolinium, which have unambiguous protonation sites, each analogous to one of the diazanaphthalene protomers (Figure 2).",
        "The FAIMS ionogram of 8-bromoquinazolinium (m/z 209, isotope 79Br) is shown in Figure 3A and contains two broad peaks each centered at compensation voltage (CV) values of -3.5 V and +0.5 V. Quinazoline can be N-protonated at the 1-© 2023 American Chemical Societyhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c02552 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 15024-15029or 3-nitrogen31 and these two FAIMS peaks are assigned as the analogous protomers of 8-bromoquinazolinium based on the interpretation of the UVPD action spectra. UVPD of 8-bromoquinazolinium gives rise to photoproducts at m/z 182, 130, 129, 103, and 76. All reported photodissociation action spectra here track the m/z 130 photofragment (arising from 79Br loss).",
        "The action spectrum of ions selected at either FAIMS CV -4 and +1 V are shown in Figure 3B and C, respectively, and there are several broad features over this range. Importantly, the CV -4 V action spectra contains a feature around 420 nm (×200 magnified, labeled I), which is absent in the CV 1 V action spectrum. At higher energies, another feature is observed around 260 nm at CV -4 V (labeled II), which is also absent in the CV +1 V spectrum.",
        "These spectra are compared to Franck-Condon (FC) CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ TD-DFT simulations,34-36 which have been red-shifted by 2000 cm-1.37 Features I and II match simulated FC transitions of 3-N protonated 8-dehydroquina-zolinium (shaded areas in Figure 3B). These transitions are absent in the FC simulation of the 1-N protomer. Based on the absence of these features, as well as the general agreement between the FC simulation and the experimental spectrum, the ion population selected using + 1 V is assigned as the 1-N protomer, and the CV -4 V population is assigned to the 3-N protomer. However, the presence of a minor population of 1-N protonated 8-dehydroquinazolium in Figure 3B cannot be definitively ruled out because feature III overlaps with feature IV in Figure 3C. These assignments are consistent with a previous study on the FAIMS separation of protonated quinazoline, which assigned the lower CV peak as the 3-N protonation site and the higher CV peak as 1-N protonation.31Once introduced into the ion trap and irradiated with a single laser pulse, photodissociation of brominated precursor [M-Br]+ forms a corresponding radical cation from Br loss (Figure 1). No isomerization is expected following PD due to the high transition state barriers with the available excess energy following C-Br bond homolysis (further details are provided in the Supporting Information). This is further supported by kinetic measurements (vide inf ra).",
        "The target radicals react with ethylene to form adducts [M + 28]+ at either m/z 157 (R3 and R4) or m/z 158 (R1 and R2). Only R3 exhibits a prominent H-atom-loss product (m/z 156). Potential energy schemes for these reactions are provided in the Supporting Information. Product mass spectra for each reaction were recorded, and ion signals are plotted as a function of reaction time in Figure 4A-D. These kineticexperiments were repeated across six ethylene concentrations, and the second-order rate coefficient for each reaction was calculated by plotting pseudo-first-order rate coefficients, extracted from these profiles, against the ethylene concen-tration within the ion trap as discussed in section I of the Supporting Information. These pseudo-first-order plots were fitted by linear regression and are plotted in Figure 4E, F. Reaction efficiencies were calculated by normalizing second-order rate coefficients to the Langevin collision rate (ethylene is a neutral molecule with no permanent dipole moment).38 Branching ratios are given in Table S1 and reaction efficiencies and second-order rate constants are listed in Table 1.",
        "The most efficient reaction is R1 (42%), followed by R2 (20%), R3 (8.2%), and R4 (1.4%). Importantly, without FAIMS separation, distinct measurements for R1 and R2 would not be straightforward. For both quinazoline-and quinoline-based radical cations, the fastest reaction occurs when the proton is closest to the radical site. Additionally, the two quinazoline based radical cations are significantly faster than their quinoline counterparts, indicating that the electron lone pair on the nitrogen accelerates the reaction.",
        "For ion-molecule distonic radical reactions, it is previously observed for 18 different reactions that the energy of the prereactive complex (PRC) has no correlation with the rate of the reaction.24,39 Instead it is the stability of a long-range PRC transition state that primarily controls the reaction rate. This transition state energy has been used to predict the reactivity of similar distonic radicals, although this parameter is sensitive and requires careful calculation and benchmarking. This means that small changes in the transition state energy will have large impacts on the predicted reaction rate. For the two protonation-isomer reactions, the optimized transition states are shown in Figure 5. Using G3X-K, a high-level composite method,40 these transition state energies do not align with theexperimental reaction efficiency trend (Table 1). R2 has the lowest calculated transition state energy (-19 kJ/mol) and is therefore expected to be the fastest reaction, but the experimental results instead show that R1 (-18 kJ/mol barrier) has over double the reaction efficiency. This transition state energy difference, however, is within the mean error of this method: ±2 kJ/mol.41To improve the treatment of these transition states each stationary point was recalculated using DSD-PBEP86/aug-cc-pVTZ � a double hybrid method better suited to model long-range electronic effects.40 Using DSD-PBEP86 the four barrier heights are in the order of the measured reaction efficiency, ascending from R1 (-20 kJ/mol, 42%) to R2 (-18 kJ/mol, 20%) to R3 (-15 kJ/mol, 8.2%) and to R4 (-13 kJ/mol, 1.4%). The differences in these values lie outside the expected mean error of these calculations (±0.4 kJ/mol)42 so this interpretation of these results is reasonable. This highlights the importance of double-hybrid methods for systems affected by long-range forces.",
        "Reaction efficiencies of similar ion-molecule reactions have been shown to generally correlate with the electron affinity of the radical cation.22,45,46 Adiabatic electron affinities for the current systems were calculated using M06-2X/6-31G-(2df,p)47,48 and are listed in Table 1. Adiabatic electron affinities for a range of other methods are provided in the Supporting Information. However, again, this does not reproduce the ordering of the experiment and serves as a caution for using electron affinities alone as a predictive parameter.",
        "To substantiate the through-space influence on the energy of these rate-limiting transition states, the difference in TS1 energy between R1 and R2 was partitioned into correlation, exchange, and Hartree components (calculated using DSD-PBEP8640) following the analysis of Gryn’ova and Coote.49 These values are summarized in Table 2. For this analysis, anegative value corresponds to a component more stabilized for R1 and a positive value corresponds to a component more stabilized for R2. A through-space electrostatic effect will manifest as a difference in the Hartree energy.49 Thus, the negative Hartree energy (-11 kJ/mol) in Table 2 reveals that the through-space electrostatic interaction is more favorable for R1 than that for R2. In contrast, the positive exchange-energy indicates that stabilization via electron delocalization is more favorable for R2, most likely due to the closer range lone-pair interaction with ethylene. The Hartree energy is the dominant component that preferentially stabilizes TS1 for R1 and it follows that the increased rate of reaction for R1 primarily derives from stronger through-space electrostatic stabilization due to the closer protonation site.",
        "In summary, these results show that differences in protonation site can dictate nearby radical reactivity, as rationalized by through-space oriented electric field consid-erations. The experimentally measured rates of reaction are significantly slower (5-20 times) for the quinoline radical cations, indicating that along with the effects of charge location, the nearby electron lone pair on the nitrogen accelerates the reaction for the two quinazoline protomers. These reaction rates correlate to the stability of the calculated long-range prereactive transition state. Importantly, due to the small energy differences between the transition states of these molecules, among the tested methods, only the double hybrid method (DSD-PBEP86) could reproduce the experimental reactivity trend. This method can be applied to any radical-ion reaction if suitable halogenated precursors can be separated with ion filtering techniques.",
