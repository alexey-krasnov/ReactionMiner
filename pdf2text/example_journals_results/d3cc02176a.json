A power conversion efficiency of 6.7% and a specific detectivity of 4.1 None 1013 Jones at 800 nm have been obtained, suggesting the promising prospects of quinoidal molecules for optoelectronic devices. Organic solar cells (OSCs) and photodetectors (OPDs) with bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends as the photoactive layers have attracted widespread attention owing to their advantages of flexibility, light weight, solution processibility, and mass-production ability.1–4 Specifically, OSCs have shown great potential in solving the energy shortage and environmental problems.1,2 With a similar working principle to OSCs, OPDs exhibited broad applications in medical diagnostics, full colour detection, X-ray imaging, etc.3,4 The past few years have witnessed the dramatic improvement of OSCs and OPDs. So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have exceeded 19%,5 and OPDs with performance close to silicon photodetectors have been achieved.6 One of the key challenges to achieve high performance OSCs and OPDs is to develop advanced electron acceptors with strong near-infrared absorption and excellent electron transport properties.7,8 Currently, the electron acceptors have been domi-nated by A–D–A0–D–A conjugated structures, where A and A0 denote electron-withdrawing units, and D denotes an electron-donating unit. The absorption spectra and energy levels of electron acceptors can be finely tuned by changing the D and A/A0 units.7,8 The introduction of quinoidal structures is an alternative method to construct high-performance electron acceptors due to a few unique advantages.9–13 First, the rigid and coplanar structure of the quinoidal unit is beneficial to the compact p–p stacking and intermolecular charge transport.9,10 Second, quinoidal units usually offer excellent delocalization of p-electrons and a strong intramolecular charge-transfer effect, thus leading to narrow optical bandgaps and high absorption coefficients.11 Third, the lactam structures of the quinoidal units can narrow the bandgap by lowering the LUMO energy levels rather than raising the HOMO energy levels,12,13 in line with the requirements of stable n-type materials. Our group has reported two quinoidal polymers based on dipyrrolopyrazine-dione, which exhibited strong light absorption in the near-infrared region and were used as electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells.14 However, research on intrinsic quinoi-dal molecules for application in OSCs and OPDs still lags behind donor–acceptor type organic semiconductors. Herein, we report a small molecular electron acceptor PzDP-IC2Cl based on an A–D–Q–D–A type conjugated skeleton and an intrinsic quinoidal dipyrrolopyrazinedione core (Scheme 1). Benefitting from the quinoidal structure and electron-withdrawing nature of dipyrrolopyrazinedione, PzDP-IC2Cl exhibited a light absorption onset over 900 nm and desirable electron acceptor properties. As a result, an OSC with a decent PCE of 6.7% and an OPD with a detectivity up to 4.1 None 1013 Jones at 800 nm have been achieved by PzDP-IC2Cl. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best OSC and the first OPD based on electron acceptors with an intrinsic quinoidal core. The synthetic route of PzDP-IC2Cl is shown in Scheme 1. Compound 2 was obtained by alkylation starting from com-pound 1. Compound 3 was then formed via a palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction using compound 2 as a starting chemical. Next, compound 4 was converted from a Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510640, China.

Finally, PzDP-IC2Cl was obtained by Knoevenagel condensation between compound 4 and 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile with a yield of 84%. The chemical structure of PzDP-IC2Cl was fully characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (MS) (Fig. S1–S12, ESI†). PzDP-IC2Cl exhi-bits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. The thermal properties of PzDP-IC2Cl were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature corresponding to 5% weight loss of PzDP-IC2Cl reached 363 1C (Fig. S13a, ESI†), suggesting good thermal stability of the molecule. In addition, no peaks of melting and crystallization can be observed during the heating and cooling cycle before thermal decomposition of the molecule (Fig. S13b, ESI†). The normalized absorption spectra of PzDP-IC2Cl in dilute solution and as a thin film are shown in Fig. 1a. The absorption peak of PzDP-IC2Cl was red-shifted from 715 to 837 nm when going from solution to the solid state. The absorption onset of PzDP-IC2Cl is located at 924 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 1.34 eV. The absorption spectrum of PzDP-IC2Cl is complementary to that of PBDB-T (Fig. S14, ESI†), which was selected as the electron donor in OSCs and OPDs in this study. The electrochemical properties of PzDP-IC2Cl were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S15, ESI†). The lowest unoccu-pied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PzDP-IC2Cl are None4.04 and None5.53 eV, respectively (Fig. 1b). The energy level offsets between PBDB-T and PzDP-IC2Cl are large enough for efficient charge transfer. The molecular geometry and electronic structures of PzDP-IC2Cl were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The molecule showed good coplanarity with a small dihedral angle of 16.711 between cyclopentadithiophene and the adjacent phenylene unit (Fig. S16, ESI†), which is conducive to intermolecular p–p stacking and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The HOMO is well delocalized along the p-conjugated skeleton, while the LUMO is mainly localized on the electron-withdrawing PzDP unit. The calculated LUMO and HOMO energy levels are None4.19 and None5.78 eV, respectively, agreeing with the results of CV measurements. The photovoltaic property of PzDP-IC2Cl was investigated in a device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag. The active layer was fully optimized in terms of donor/acceptor weight ratio, thermal annealing, etc. (Table S1, ESI†). The current density–voltage ( J–V) characteristics of the OSCs under AM1.5G (100 mW cmNone2) irradiation are shown in Fig. 1c, and corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. The as-cast device processed from chloroform afforded a PCE of 3.45% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.67 V, a short-circuit current density ( Jsc) of 11.1 mA cm None2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.470. After introducing 0.5% (v/v) bromonaphthalene (BN) as a solvent additive, the device yielded an improved PCE of 6.70% This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Commun.due to boosted Jsc (16.1 mA cm None2) and FF (0.603). The improve-ment in Jsc has been confirmed by the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) with less than 5% deviations, as shown in Fig. 1d. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured to study the charge transfer behaviors in the OSCs (Fig. S17, ESI†). Both the as-cast and BN treated blend films showed high PL quenching efficiency (DPL) when excited at 555 nm, imply-ing efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor. Upon exciting at 730 nm, the BN treated device showed higher DPL (84.2%) than the as-cast device (74.7%), indicating more effi-cient hole transfer after BN treatment. The photocurrent den-sity (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation behaviors in the OSCs (Fig. S18, ESI†). The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) of the as-cast and BN treated devices were calculated to be 73.1% and 88.2%, respectively, suggesting that BN treatment improved the probability of exciton dissociation in the OSC. Charge transport properties were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S19, ESI†). The hole mobility (mh) and electron mobility (me) of the BN treated device were 1.30 None 10None4 and 9.18 None 10None5 cm2 VNone1 sNone1, respectively, which are higher and more balanced than those of the as-cast device (mh = 5.26 None 10None5, me = 2.35 None 10None5 cm2 VNone1 sNone1). The results indicated that BN treatment can effectively improve charge transport, which was consistent with the improvement of Jsc and FF. The charge recombination kinetics were investigated by measuring the Jsc and Voc under different light intensity (Plight). The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be described as Jsc p Palight. It is believed that the closer a is to 1, the less bimolecular recombination probability is in the devices.15 The two OSCs exhibited very close a values (0.967 versus 0.972), which implies negligible bimolecular recombination in these devices (Fig. S20a, ESI†). The plots of ln(Plight) and Voc are depicted in Fig. S20b (ESI†), where the slope of the linear section should be nkT/q (1 o n o 2), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature and q is the charge of the primary charge. A larger n indicates more trap-assisted recombination.15 The n values of the as-cast and BN treated devices were 1.22 and 1.15, respectively. These results suggested that BN treatment reduced the trap-assisted recombination in the OSC, leading to a higher Jsc and FF. The morphology of the blend films was investigated by trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S21a (ESI†), the as-cast blend films exhibited distinct agglomeration, which is detrimental to the formation of the bicontinuous interpenetrat-ing network structure. Instead, the morphology of the BN-treated films was more homogeneous, which is more favorable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the OSC. We further used two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) to investigate the molecular packing and orientation in the two films, as shown in Fig. S21b (ESI†). The corresponding numerical data are summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The PzDP-IC2Cl neat film showed a strong (100) peak at q = 0.36 ÅNone1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a strong (010) peak at q = 1.80 ÅNone1 in the in-plane (IP) direction, indicating a predominant edge-on orientation. For the as-cast blend film, the IP (010) and OOP (100) diffraction peaks of PzDP-IC2Cl as well as the OOP (010) and IP (100) diffraction peaks of PBDB-T were maintained, implying that the molecular orientation and stacking ordering of the donor and acceptor were not disrupted upon blending. After BN treatment, the diffraction peaks at q = 0.29 and q = 0.40 ÅNone1 in the IP direction emerged, while the IP (010) diffraction peak at q = 1.80 ÅNone1 disappeared. These results Chem. Commun.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023suggested the suppressed edge-on orientation and enhanced face-on orientation of PzDP-IC2Cl. The maintained ordering and face-on orientation were beneficial to charge transport, which supports the higher Jsc and FF. Inspired by the decent EQE of the PzDP-IC2Cl-based OSC in the near-infrared region (Fig. 1d), we further explored the potential of a quinoidal molecule in OPDs. Generally, a vertical composition distribution in the active layer and the work function of the interlayer have significant impacts on the performance of OPDs.16 Therefore, the OPD performance of PzDP-IC2Cl was evaluated in both conventional and inverted devices (Fig. S22, ESI†). The EQE spectra and responsivities (R) of the OPDs with different device structures were almost the same (Fig. S23, ESI† and Fig. 2a). However, the dark current density ( Jd) of the inverted device was about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the conventional device (Fig. 2b), resulting in a much higher detectivity (D*) of 4.12 None 1013 Jones at 800 nm under 0 V bias (Fig. 2c). The numerical parameters of the OPDs are summarized in Table 2. It is widely known that Jd is closely related to charge injection. A vertical composition distribution in the active layer may have a significant impact on the Jd of OPDs. A vertical composition distribution with the donor enriched at the anode side and acceptor enriched at the cathode side is more favor-able to block the undesirable charge injection (Fig. 2e). There-fore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to elucidate the differences of Jd in OPDs. We chose nitrogen as the characteristic element of PzDP-IC2Cl. As shown in Fig. 2d, the content of nitrogen increased with the etching time, indicating an increased PzDP-IC2Cl content in the bottom of the active layer. Obviously, the vertical distribution of PzDP-IC2Cl was more likely to block the undesirable charge injection in the inverted structure, which led to a lower Jd. In addition, the energy level is also connected to the interface energy barrier. The work function of MoO3 (None5.4 eV) is considerably deeper than that of PEDOT:PSS (None5.1 eV), which built a larger energy barrier for undesirable electron injection from anode contact (Fig. 2f) and contributed to the lower Jd. In summary, a novel small molecular acceptor PzDP-IC2Cl with near-infrared light absorption and appropriate energy levels based on an intrinsic quinoidal core was developed. By blending with PBDB-T in OSCs, a record-high efficiency among small molecular acceptors with an intrinsic quinoidal core was realized by PzDP-IC2Cl. The newly developed quinoidal acceptor was also applied in OPDs for the first time and a detectivity up to 4.1 None 1013 Jones at 800 nm under 0 V bias was obtained. Overall, this work demonstrated the promis-ing potential of quinoidal molecules in bulk-heterojunction organic optoelectronic devices.

The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be described as Jsc p Palight. It is believed that the closer a is to 1, the less bimolecular recombination probability is in the devices.15 The two OSCs exhibited very close a values (0.967 versus 0.972), which implies negligible bimolecular recombination in these devices (Fig. S20a, ESI†). The plots of ln(Plight) and Voc are depicted in Fig. S20b (ESI†), where the slope of the linear section should be nkT/q (1 o n o 2), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature and q is the charge of the primary charge. A larger n indicates more trap-assisted recombination.15 The n values of the as-cast and BN treated devices were 1.22 and 1.15, respectively. These results suggested that BN treatment reduced the trap-assisted recombination in the OSC, leading to a higher Jsc and FF.",
        "The morphology of the blend films was investigated by trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S21a (ESI†), the as-cast blend films exhibited distinct agglomeration, which is detrimental to the formation of the bicontinuous interpenetrat-ing network structure. Instead, the morphology of the BN-treatedfilms was more homogeneous, which is more favorable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the OSC. We further used two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) to investigate the molecular packing and orientation in the two films, as shown in Fig. S21b (ESI†). The corresponding numerical data are summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The PzDP-IC2Cl neat film showed a strong (100) peak at q = 0.36 ÅNone1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a strong (010) peak at q = 1.80 ÅNone1 in the in-plane (IP) direction, indicating a predominant edge-on orientation. For the as-cast blend film, the IP (010) and OOP (100) diffraction peaks of PzDP-IC2Cl as well as the OOP (010) and IP (100) diffraction peaks of PBDB-T were maintained, implying that the molecular orientation and stacking ordering of the donor and acceptor were not disrupted upon blending. After BN treatment, the diffraction peaks at q = 0.29 and q = 0.40 ÅNone1 in the IP direction emerged, while the IP (010) diffraction peak at q = 1.80 ÅNone1 disappeared. These resultsChem. Commun.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023suggested the suppressed edge-on orientation and enhanced face-on orientation of PzDP-IC2Cl. The maintained ordering and face-on orientation were beneficial to charge transport, which supports the higher Jsc and FF.",
        "Inspired by the decent EQE of the PzDP-IC2Cl-based OSC in the near-infrared region (Fig. 1d), we further explored the potential of a quinoidal molecule in OPDs. Generally, a vertical composition distribution in the active layer and the work function of the interlayer have significant impacts on the performance of OPDs.16 Therefore, the OPD performance of PzDP-IC2Cl was evaluated in both conventional and inverted devices (Fig. S22, ESI†). The EQE spectra and responsivities (R) of the OPDs with different device structures were almost the same (Fig. S23, ESI† and Fig. 2a). However, the dark current density ( Jd) of the inverted device was about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the conventional device (Fig. 2b), resulting in a much higher detectivity (D*) of 4.12 None 1013 Jones at 800 nm under 0 V bias (Fig. 2c). The numerical parameters of the OPDs are summarized in Table 2.",
        "It is widely known that Jd is closely related to charge injection. A vertical composition distribution in the active layer may have a significant impact on the Jd of OPDs. A vertical composition distribution with the donor enriched at the anode side and acceptor enriched at the cathode side is more favor-able to block the undesirable charge injection (Fig. 2e). There-fore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to elucidate the differences of Jd in OPDs. We chose nitrogen as the characteristic element of PzDP-IC2Cl. As shown in Fig. 2d, the content of nitrogen increased with the etching time, indicating an increased PzDP-IC2Cl content in the bottom of the active layer. Obviously, the vertical distribution of PzDP-IC2Cl was more likely to block the undesirable charge injection in the inverted structure, which led to a lower Jd. In addition, the energy level is also connected to the interface energy barrier. The work function of MoO3 (None5.4 eV) is considerably deeper than that of PEDOT:PSS (None5.1 eV), which built a larger energy barrier for undesirable electron injection from anode contact (Fig. 2f) and contributed to the lower Jd.",
        "In summary, a novel small molecular acceptor PzDP-IC2Cl with near-infrared light absorption and appropriate energy levels based on an intrinsic quinoidal core was developed. By blending with PBDB-T in OSCs, a record-high efficiency among small molecular acceptors with an intrinsic quinoidal core was realized by PzDP-IC2Cl. The newly developed quinoidalacceptor was also applied in OPDs for the first time and a detectivity up to 4.1 None 1013 Jones at 800 nm under 0 V bias was obtained. Overall, this work demonstrated the promis-ing potential of quinoidal molecules in bulk-heterojunction organic optoelectronic devices.
