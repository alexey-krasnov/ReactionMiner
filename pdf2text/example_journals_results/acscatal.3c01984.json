We show here that 5.7 nm CdS QDs are robust photocatalysts for photoredox-promoted cross-electrophile coupling (turnover number (TON) up to 40,000). These conditions can be utilized on a small scale (96-well plate) or adapted to flow. NMR studies show that triethanol-amine (TEOA)-capped QDs are the active catalyst and that TEOA can displace native phosphonate and carboxylate ligands, demonstrating the importance of the QD surface chemistry. KEYWORDS: quantum dot, nanoplatelet, nickel, cross-electrophile coupling, C-C bond formation, photochemistry Photoredox chemistry employing transition metal cocata-lysts is a powerful strategy for C-C bond formation1-3 but is generally limited by a small number of photoredox catalysts. For example, photoredox-promoted cross-electro-phile coupling (PPXEC) procedures commonly require iridium-based dyes, stoichiometric use of expensive and high-molecular-weight silane reductants, or both (Scheme 1A).4-11 Despite this, PPXEC is widely utilized on a small scale and would be an attractive approach to large-scale XEC if costs could be decreased. Both Vannucci’s and Lei’s PPXEC approaches avoided the need for silane reagents, which can be expensive and often introduce purification challenges, but required Ir dyes.12,13 Precious-metal dyes are among the most developed metallaphotoredox catalysts, yet there are concerns surrounding the security of the platinum-group metal supply14 and expense of these dyes at large scale. Recent reports have introduced organophotocatalysts, sometimes alongside non-silane reductants,15-18 but these catalysts are also expensive for large-scale use and often require higher catalyst loadings. There is a need for scalable PPXEC catalysts that do not suffer from these hurdles. Our group and others have evaluated semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as replacements for precious-metal dyes in a variety of photoredox19-23 and redox-neutral metallaphotoredox reactions,20,24-26 but their viability for reductive metallaphotoredox catalysis remains unexplored (Scheme 1B). QDs could be an ideal replacement for precious metals and organic dyes due to their tunable visible absorption,27 large molar absorptivity coefficients,28 well-defined syntheses from inexpensive precursors,29,30 solution stability in organic solvents, and high photostability,31-33 among other advantages.34-38 However, we envisioned several challenges in realizing a QD-catalyzed PPXEC reaction. The low concentrations of QDs typically employed,39,40 combined with shorter excited-state lifetimes,41-43 could give sluggish bimolecular quenching with a metal cocatalyst. Second, QDs can bind or react with metal ions44-46 and common organic functional groups,47-49 and undesired side reactivity between the QDs, metal cocatalysts, and reactants could inhibit catalysis. Finally, given the wide array of available QDs and nanomaterials,30 the choice of appropriate nanomaterial composition and morphology was not obvious. We report here a systematic investigation of the use of QDs in a model PPXEC reaction that illustrates that CdS QDs are as effective as small-molecule dyes (Scheme 1C). Binding studies reveal that the terminal reductant (triethanolamine), a reported QD ligand,50-53 replaces the native QD ligands in situ, remodeling the QD surface for optimal reactivity. To identify the optimal nanomaterial photocatalysts for PPXEC, we examined several nanomaterials (reported in mol % nanomaterial) of differing morphologies, sizes, and electronic/chemical characteristics (see Supporting Informa-tion (SI) section 2 for characterization details).20,54-61 The 5.7 nm CdS QDs (size determined by TEM imaging; see SI section 2 for sizing details) were the most effective photo-Received: May 2, 2023 Revised: June 16, 2023 Published: June 22, 2023 Letterpubs.acs.org/acscatalysis © 2023 American Chemical Society 9018 https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c01984 ACS Catal. 2023, 13, 9018-9024 D ow nl oa de d vi a U N IV  IL L IN O IS  UR B A N A -C H A M PA IG N  on Ju ly  21,  202 3 at  00: 23 :4 5 (U T C ).

Employing higher-energy 390 nm irradiation to better excite 3.9 nm CdS QDs was also detrimental (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Because dehalogenation has been associated with over-reduction of arylnickel(II) intermediates,62 the increased amount of dehalogenation observed with smaller-diameter QDs suggests that larger band gap energies play a negative role. On the other hand, among different sized CdS QDs, the increased yield does not appear to be due to absorbance of more photons (see Figure S2). Overall, a number of size-dependent factors may account for the superior performance of the larger 5.7 nm CdS QDs compared to the other nanomaterials, including the extinction coefficients, band edge positions, and ligand coverage. CdSe QDs, which exhibit smaller band gaps and lower valence band potentials than CdS,27,63 did not provide the product in any appreciable yield (Table 1, entries 7 and 8), possibly due to insufficient driving force required for efficient oxidation of amine reductants. Both bulk and nanocrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskites, possessing similar band gaps to 5.7 nm CdS, were completely ineffective (Table 1, entries 9 and 10), likely due to their rapid dissolution in polar environments unless functionalized with stabilizing ligands,60 highlighting a fundamental challenge in the use of perovskite photocatalysts for organic chemistry. Preliminary attempts to use ∼4.5 monolayer (ML) CdSe and CdS nanoplatelets, unexplored materials for metallaphotoredox catalysis, afforded promising yields (Table 1, entries 11-14) with very high total TONs (in some cases >500,000; see SI section 5 for details). While more concentrated nanoplatelet (NPL) solutions were problematic, comparison of NPLs with QDs at the same (lower) concentration demonstrated that NPLs can be more productive per particle (see Table S5). Due to the greater synthetic complexity of NPLs64 and their lower initial performance, we opted to continue using 5.7 nm CdS QDs in this study. However, the high molar productivity of the NPLs suggests their significant potential as photoredox catalysts in future applications. The optimized conditions employ NiCl2(dme) with terpyridine as a ligand for Ni, utilizing triethanolamine (TEOA) as a homogeneous terminal reductant, with 5.7 nm CdS QDs (2.0 × 10-3 mol %) and blue LEDs. Reducing the loading of Ni/ligand or reductant produced diminished yields (Table 2, entries 1-3). Use of alternative tertiary amine reductants instead of TEOA gave greatly diminished yields despite exhibiting similar oxidation potentials65-68 (Table 2, entries 4-7). Furthermore, the steady-state photolumines-cence of the QDs was quenched to a greater extent by TEOA than DIPEA or Et3N (SI section 5.2), consistent with its superior performance. Lowering the QD loading was detrimental, while bulk CdS powder was not an effective photocatalyst (Table 2, entries 8 and 9). Control experiments verified that all components were necessary for product formation (Table 2, entry 10). We then briefly investigated the compatibility of the CdS QD/TEOA system with synthetically relevant substrates (Scheme 2). Electron-rich and -neutral aryl iodides were cross-coupled in good yields (3a-3c), while heteroaryl iodides including pyridine, indole, pyrazole, and indazole (3g-3j) could also be coupled. When electron-poor aryl iodides were used, significant amounts of hydrodehalogenated product were observed, consistent with the ability of CdX QDs (X = S, Se) to directly reduce electron-poor aryl iodides.69 Electron-poor aryl bromides could also be coupled, albeit requiring 1.5 equiv of ArBr to achieve good yields (3d-3f). Following this trend, electron-poor heteroaryl moieties, including pyridine (3q) and pyrimidine (3r, 3s), could be coupled in moderate yield. Additionally, both primary (3a-3l, 3o, and 3p) and secondary alkyl bromides (3m, 3n, 3t, and 3u) could be coupled using this method. Synthetically valuable moieties, including halides, nitriles, ketones, esters, and protected amines, were generally well-tolerated. Corey lactone-derived 3o and uridine-derived 3p were afforded in good yields without the epimerization of chiral centers. In the optimized reaction (Table 1, entry 1), the remainder of the mass balance was primarily protodehalogenation (PhH) with small amounts of remaining starting material and alkyl dimer. For the lower-yielding reactions in Scheme 2, protodehalogenation and alkyl dimerization were the main side products. For less reactive aryl halides, substantial amounts of the aryl halide remained. The advantages of inexpensive production and robust solution stability render QDs an ideal photocatalyst platform for large-scale applications.70 We found that 3l could be scaled up to 5 mmol scale on the benchtop in batch mode, and 3c could be scaled to 7.5 mmol in a flow reactor (Scheme 2). The latter reaction used only 0.001 mol % QDs (corresponding to a material cost of $0.26; see SI section 3.4 for details). Furthermore, the reaction conditions could be readily applied to a smaller-scale, high-throughput format, utilizing a commercial 96-well plate equipped with a blue LED array on a shaker plate (see SI section 3.2 for details regarding setup and heat map data). Modulation of the QD ligand environment by precursory exchange or in situ interactions with reaction components is known to strongly impact catalysis by changing the permeability of the ligand sphere.71-74 To determine whether TEOA enables optimal QD performance through surface modification, we monitored the displacement of native oleate ligands from the QD surface upon treatment with TEOA via 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1). Alcohols have been proposed to undergo X-type ligand exchange with carboxylate QD ligands75 but are not commonly employed as capping ligands for QDs.76-78 Triethanolamine has been explored as a water-solubilizing ligand for QDs in sensing applications,50,51 but ligand exchange dynamics and photocatalysis with TEOA-capped QDs have not been explored. Our 1H NMR study showed oleate displacement from the QD surface by TEOA upon addition of TEOA equivalencies well below that of the catalytic reaction (Figures S4 and S7). Meanwhile, Et3N and DIPEA displaced only a small fraction of the oleates on the QD surface (Figure S8). TEOA also displaced undec-10-en-1-ylphosphonic acid (UDPA) ligands from CdS (Figure S5). UDPA is known to bind more strongly than carboxylates to Cd sites on QD surfaces.79 This similar efficacy of displacement together with TEOA’s ability to form stable Cd(II) chelates80 suggests that TEOA may remove ligands by chelation and stripping of surface-bound CdX2 (X = UDPA or oleate) complexes rather than undergoing X-type ligand exchange.81,82 Accompanying oleate displacement, a large negative nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlation was observed between the methylene resonances of TEOA in the presence of QDs, indicating their dynamic association with the exposed QD surface following the displacement of surface-bound Cd-(oleate)2 (Figure S7). 83 While the binding mode of TEOA to the QD surface in this particular system remains unknown (i.e., L-vs X-type, binding through the amine vs hydroxyl moieties), our experiments are consistent with in situ formation of TEOA-capped QDs as the active catalyst under the optimal conditions (Figure 1). Structurally similar tertiary amines bearing zero or one hydroxyl group were less effective reductants, but two hydroxyl groups provided similar results (Table 2, entries 4-7), suggesting that some level of chelation is critical to function as a surface-remodeling reductant.84 In conclusion, we have demonstrated how CdS QDs with TEOA constitute a cost-effective photoreduction system for Ni-mediated cross-electrophile coupling that demonstrates a broad scope and good scalability. NMR studies illustrate the role of TEOA as a surface-binding reductant and how surface remodeling could be used to improve the reductive chemistry with QDs. Continuing studies on the use of nanomaterials for organic synthesis are ongoing and will be reported in due course.

Our optimal QDs are not yet commercially available, while the final costs of using molecular photocatalysts depend on catalyst sourcing, loading, and purification considerations. However, the bulk prices of respective precursor materials are illustrative: CdS QDs are produced using CdO ($14/mol, Alfa Aesar) and sulfur (<1¢/mol). Ir photocatalysts are usually produced from IrCl3 ($57,660/mol, Pressure Chemical) and heteroaromatic organic ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Letter https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c01984 ACS Catal. 2023, 13, 9018-9024 9023 ligands which impart variable synthetic costs. Isophthalonitrile photocatalysts are typically prepared from tetrafluoroisophthalonitrile ($1,376/mol, Ambeed) and various aromatic amines. Moreover, CdS QDs can be prepared in a single step and isolated without chromatography. (71) Zhang, Z.; Edme, K.; Lian, S.; Weiss, E. A.

        "CdS Quantum Dots for Metallaphotoredox-Enabled Cross-Electrophile Coupling of Aryl Halides with Alkyl Halides",
        "Julianna M. Mouat, Jonas K. Widness, Daniel G. Enny, Mahilet T. Meidenbauer, Farwa Awan, Todd D. Krauss,* and Daniel J. Weix*ABSTRACT: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) offer many advan-tages as photocatalysts for synthetic photoredox catalysis, but no reports have explored the use of QDs with nickel catalysts for C-C bond formation. We show here that 5.7 nm CdS QDs are robust photocatalysts for photoredox-promoted cross-electrophile coupling (turnover number (TON) up to 40,000). These conditions can be utilized on a small scale (96-well plate) or adapted to flow. NMR studies show that triethanol-amine (TEOA)-capped QDs are the active catalyst and that TEOA can displace native phosphonate and carboxylate ligands, demonstrating the importance of the QD surface chemistry. KEYWORDS: quantum dot, nanoplatelet, nickel, cross-electrophile coupling, C-C bond formation, photochemistrychemistry employing transition metal cocata-lystsis a powerful strategy for C-C bond formation1-3but is generally limited by a small number of photoredox catalysts. For example, photoredox-promoted cross-electro-phile coupling (PPXEC) procedures commonly require iridium-based dyes, stoichiometric use of expensive and high-molecular-weight silane reductants, or both (Scheme 1A).4-11 Despite this, PPXEC is widely utilized on a small scale and would be an attractive approach to large-scale XEC if costs could be decreased. Both Vannucci’s and Lei’s PPXEC approaches avoided the need for silane reagents, which can be expensive and often introduce purification challenges, but required Ir dyes.12,13 Precious-metal dyes are among the most developed metallaphotoredox catalysts, yet there are concerns surrounding the security of the platinum-group metal supply14 and expense of these dyes at large scale. Recent reports have introduced organophotocatalysts, sometimes alongside non-silane reductants,15-18 but these catalysts are also expensive for large-scale use and often require higher catalyst loadings. There is a need for scalable PPXEC catalysts that do not suffer from these hurdles.",
        "Our group and others have evaluated semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as replacements for precious-metal dyes in a variety of photoredox19-23 and redox-neutral metallaphotoredox reactions,20,24-26 but their viability for reductive metallaphotoredox catalysis remains unexplored (Scheme 1B). QDs could be an ideal replacement for precious metals and organic dyes due to their tunable visible absorption,27 large molar absorptivity coefficients,28 well-defined syntheses from inexpensive precursors,29,30 solution stability in organic solvents, and high photostability,31-33 among other advantages.34-38 However, we envisioned several challenges in realizing a QD-catalyzed PPXEC reaction. The low concentrations of QDs typically employed,39,40 combined with shorter excited-state lifetimes,41-43 could give sluggish bimolecular quenching with a metal cocatalyst. Second, QDs can bind or react with metal ions44-46 and common organic functional groups,47-49 and undesired side reactivity between the QDs, metal cocatalysts, and reactants could inhibit catalysis. Finally, given the wide array of available QDs and nanomaterials,30 the choice of appropriate nanomaterial composition and morphology was not obvious. We report here a systematic investigation of the use of QDs in a model PPXEC reaction that illustrates that CdS QDs are as effective as small-molecule dyes (Scheme 1C). Binding studies reveal that the terminal reductant (triethanolamine), a reported QD ligand,50-53 replaces the native QD ligands in situ, remodeling the QD surface for optimal reactivity.",
        "To identify the optimal nanomaterial photocatalysts for PPXEC, we examined several nanomaterials (reported in mol % nanomaterial) of differing morphologies, sizes, and electronic/chemical characteristics (see Supporting Informa-tion (SI) section 2 for characterization details).20,54-61 The 5.7 nm CdS QDs (size determined by TEM imaging; see SI section 2 for sizing details) were the most effective photo-© 2023 American Chemical Societycatalyst for this transformation (turnover number (TON) of ∼40,000), while smaller CdS QDs gave lower yields of product and more dehalogenated arene (Table 1, entries 1-4). Employing higher-energy 390 nm irradiation to better excite 3.9 nm CdS QDs was also detrimental (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Because dehalogenation has been associated with over-reduction of arylnickel(II) intermediates,62 the increased amount of dehalogenation observed with smaller-diameter QDs suggests that larger band gap energies play a negative role. On the other hand, among different sized CdS QDs, the increased yield does not appear to be due to absorbance of more photons (see Figure S2). Overall, a number of size-dependent factors may account for the superior performance of the larger 5.7 nm CdS QDs compared to the other nanomaterials, including the extinction coefficients, band edge positions, and ligand coverage.",
        "CdSe QDs, which exhibit smaller band gaps and lower valence band potentials than CdS,27,63 did not provide the product in any appreciable yield (Table 1, entries 7 and 8), possibly due to insufficient driving force required for efficient oxidation of amine reductants. Both bulk and nanocrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskites, possessing similar band gaps to 5.7 nm CdS, were completely ineffective (Table 1, entries 9 and 10), likely due to their rapid dissolution in polar environments unless functionalized with stabilizing ligands,60 highlighting a fundamental challenge in the use of perovskite photocatalysts for organic chemistry. Preliminary attempts to use ∼4.5 monolayer (ML) CdSe and CdS nanoplatelets, unexplored materials for metallaphotoredox catalysis, afforded promising yields (Table 1, entries 11-14) with very high total TONs (in some cases >500,000; see SI section 5 for details). While more concentrated nanoplatelet (NPL) solutions were problematic, comparison of NPLs with QDs at the same (lower) concentration demonstrated that NPLs can be more productive per particle (see Table S5). Due to the greater synthetic complexity of NPLs64 and their lower initial performance, we opted to continue using 5.7 nm CdS QDs in this study. However, the high molar productivity of the NPLs suggests their significant potential as photoredox catalysts in future applications.",
        "The optimized conditions employ NiCl2(dme) with terpyridine as a ligand for Ni, utilizing triethanolamine(TEOA) as a homogeneous terminal reductant, with 5.7 nm CdS QDs (2.0 × 10-3 mol %) and blue LEDs. Reducing the loading of Ni/ligand or reductant produced diminished yields (Table 2, entries 1-3). Use of alternative tertiary amine reductants instead of TEOA gave greatly diminished yields despite exhibiting similar oxidation potentials65-68 (Table 2, entries 4-7). Furthermore, the steady-state photolumines-cence of the QDs was quenched to a greater extent by TEOA than DIPEA or Et3N (SI section 5.2), consistent with its superior performance. Lowering the QD loading was detrimental, while bulk CdS powder was not an effective photocatalyst (Table 2, entries 8 and 9). Control experiments verified that all components were necessary for product formation (Table 2, entry 10).",
        "We then briefly investigated the compatibility of the CdS QD/TEOA system with synthetically relevant substrates (Scheme 2). Electron-rich and -neutral aryl iodides were cross-coupled in good yields (3a-3c), while heteroaryl iodides including pyridine, indole, pyrazole, and indazole (3g-3j) could also be coupled. When electron-poor aryl iodides were used, significant amounts of hydrodehalogenated product were observed, consistent with the ability of CdX QDs (X = S, Se) to directly reduce electron-poor aryl iodides.69 Electron-pooraryl bromides could also be coupled, albeit requiring 1.5 equiv of ArBr to achieve good yields (3d-3f). Following this trend, electron-poor heteroaryl moieties, including pyridine (3q) and pyrimidine (3r, 3s), could be coupled in moderate yield. Additionally, both primary (3a-3l, 3o, and 3p) and secondary alkyl bromides (3m, 3n, 3t, and 3u) could be coupled using this method. Synthetically valuable moieties, including halides, nitriles, ketones, esters, and protected amines, were generally well-tolerated. Corey lactone-derived 3o and uridine-derived 3p were afforded in good yields without the epimerization of chiral centers.",
        "In the optimized reaction (Table 1, entry 1), the remainder of the mass balance was primarily protodehalogenation (PhH) with small amounts of remaining starting material and alkyl dimer. For the lower-yielding reactions in Scheme 2, protodehalogenation and alkyl dimerization were the main side products. For less reactive aryl halides, substantial amounts of the aryl halide remained.",
        "The advantages of inexpensive production and robust solution stability render QDs an ideal photocatalyst platform for large-scale applications.70 We found that 3l could be scaled up to 5 mmol scale on the benchtop in batch mode, and 3c could be scaled to 7.5 mmol in a flow reactor (Scheme 2). The latter reaction used only 0.001 mol % QDs (corresponding to a material cost of $0.26; see SI section 3.4 for details).",
        "Furthermore, the reaction conditions could be readily applied to a smaller-scale, high-throughput format, utilizing a commercial 96-well plate equipped with a blue LED array on a shaker plate (see SI section 3.2 for details regarding setup and heat map data).",
        "Modulation of the QD ligand environment by precursory exchange or in situ interactions with reaction components is known to strongly impact catalysis by changing the permeability of the ligand sphere.71-74 To determine whether TEOA enables optimal QD performance through surface modification, we monitored the displacement of native oleate ligands from the QD surface upon treatment with TEOA via 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1). Alcohols have been proposed to undergo X-type ligand exchange with carboxylate QD ligands75 but are not commonly employed as capping ligands for QDs.76-78 Triethanolamine has been explored as a water-solubilizing ligand for QDs in sensing applications,50,51 but ligand exchange dynamics and photocatalysis with TEOA-capped QDs have not been explored. Our 1H NMR study showed oleate displacement from the QD surface by TEOA upon addition of TEOA equivalencies well below that of the catalytic reaction (Figures S4 and S7). Meanwhile, Et3N and DIPEA displaced only a small fraction of the oleates on the QD surface (Figure S8). TEOA also displaced undec-10-en-1-ylphosphonic acid (UDPA) ligands from CdS (Figure S5). UDPA is known to bind more strongly than carboxylates to Cd sites on QD surfaces.79 This similar efficacy of displacement together with TEOA’s ability to form stable Cd(II) chelates80 suggests that TEOA may remove ligands by chelation and stripping of surface-bound CdX2 (X = UDPA or oleate) complexes rather than undergoing X-type ligand exchange.81,82 Accompanying oleate displacement, a large negative nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlation was observed between the methylene resonances of TEOA in the presence of QDs, indicating their dynamic association with the exposed QD surface following the displacement of surface-bound Cd-(oleate)2 (Figure S7). 83 While the binding mode of TEOA to the QD surface in this particular system remains unknown (i.e., L-vs X-type, binding through the amine vs hydroxyl moieties), our experiments are consistent with in situ formation of TEOA-capped QDs as the active catalyst under the optimal conditions (Figure 1). Structurally similar tertiary amines bearing zero or one hydroxyl group were less effective reductants, but two hydroxyl groups provided similar results (Table 2, entries 4-7), suggesting that some level of chelation is critical to function as a surface-remodeling reductant.84In conclusion, we have demonstrated how CdS QDs with TEOA constitute a cost-effective photoreduction system for Ni-mediated cross-electrophile coupling that demonstrates a broad scope and good scalability. NMR studies illustrate the role of TEOA as a surface-binding reductant and how surface remodeling could be used to improve the reductive chemistry with QDs. Continuing studies on the use of nanomaterials for organic synthesis are ongoing and will be reported in due course.",

Our optimal QDs are not yet commercially available, while the final costs of using molecular photocatalysts depend on catalyst sourcing, loading, and purification considerations. However, the bulk prices of respective precursor materials are illustrative: CdS QDs are produced using CdO ($14/mol, Alfa Aesar) and sulfur (<1¢/mol). Ir photocatalysts are usually produced from IrCl3 ($57,660/mol, Pressure Chemical) and heteroaromatic organicACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Letterligands which impart variable synthetic costs. Isophthalonitrile photocatalysts are typically prepared from tetrafluoroisophthalonitrile ($1,376/mol, Ambeed) and various aromatic amines. Moreover, CdS QDs can be prepared in a single step and isolated without chromatography. (71) Zhang, Z.; Edme, K.; Lian, S.; Weiss, E. A.
