The N-heterocyclic alcohols ionize to produce reactive, dicationic intermediates which provide good to excellent yields of arylation products.  INTRODUCTION Functionalized heterocyclic compounds are important syn-thetic targets. Roughly 70% of clinically useful pharmaceutical compounds contains one or more heterocyclic rings.1 Improved access to heterocyclic scaffolds can lower the costs of pharmaceutical intermediates and provide routes to new chemical space for drug development. Heterocyclic com-pounds are also useful in numerous other applications, such as materials science,2 agrochemicals,3 and dyes/pigments.4 Many important N-heterocyclic compounds contain aryl substituent groups�for example, pheniramine (an antihistamine drug), the fluorescent molecule used in an organic light-emitting diode, and boscalid (an antifungal agrochemical). While aryl substituents may be installed by a number of useful synthetic methods, our group has utilized dicationic electrophiles in the Friedel-Crafts reaction to prepare aryl-functionalized hetero-cycles and other products (1).5 For example, amino alcohols and olefinic N-heterocycles provide the arylated products (1 and 2) in excellent yields by reaction in superacidic CF3SO3H (triflic acid).5a,b These conversions involve the formation of the super-electrophilic intermediates (3 and 4) which react readily with arene nucleophiles. Similarly, we demonstrated that N-heterocyclic alcohols may be ionized in superacid to give aza-polycyclic aromatic compounds, presumably through dications.5c An AlCl3-promoted transformation had been reported, giving phenylated products from an imidazole alcohol, and another arylation has been demonstrated with 2-hydroxymethylbenzimidazoles.6,7 Nevertheless, the use of N-heterocyclic alcohols in Friedel-Crafts reactions has not been widely employed. In the following manuscript, we describe the use of this synthetic methodology to prepare aryl-function-alized N-heterocycles. Mechanisms are proposed involving dicationic electrophilic intermediates.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Our initial studies examined the reactions of 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5) in its reactions with triflic acid and arene nucleophiles (Scheme 1). When alcohol 5 is reacted with triflic acid (10 equiv) in the presence of benzene, a nearly quantitative yield of the Friedel-Crafts product (6) is Received: February 22, 2023 Articlepubs.acs.org/joc © XXXX American Chemical Society A https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.3c00403 J.

However, H2SO4 did provide a conversion to the elimination product, 4-(2-propenyl)pyridine. Using lower quantities of triflic acid likewise produced large amounts of 4-(2-propenyl)pyridine. With chloro-and bromobenzene, the arylated products (7-8) are obtained in good yields, while dichlorobenzenes lead to a significantly lower yield of the arylated products (9-10). Presumably, this is due to the deactivation of the aromatic ring by the chloro substituents. Although toluene provides the Friedel-Crafts product 11 in quantitative yield, it is formed as the mixture of regioisomers (like compounds 7 and 8). The observed product yields are consistent with the formation of reactive electrophiles, ones that is capable of reacting with deactivated arenes such dichlorobenzene. The Friedel-Crafts chemistry is found to be effective with a variety of N-heterocyclic alcohol substrates (Table 1). Like the 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5), the isomeric 2-(2-pyridyl)-2-propanol gives the corresponding phenylation product 12 in high yield. With increasing distance between the two sites of ionization, the chemistry remains highly effective. Thus, ionization of 4-(2-pyridyl)-2-methyl-2-butanol provides the phenylated product 15 four carbons away from the pyridine nitrogen. Other N-heterocycles give conversions to the respective Friedel-Crafts products, including quinolyl (16), imidazolyl (17), thioazolyl (18), and quinoxalyl (19). The quinoxalyl product is produced in lower yield because of its tendency to form an elimination product. Although the Friedel-Crafts chemistry did not show good regioselectivity with halogen-substituted benzenes (Scheme 1), a single regioisomer of the triarylethane (20) was prepared in good yield by installation of the 4-fluorophenyl group in the starting N-heterocyclic alcohol. Structurally diverse products may be prepared starting from cyclic ketones. For example, cyclo-hexanone provides the heterocyclic alcohol from 2-lithiopyr-idine, and the subsequent Friedel-Crafts reaction gives product 21. Similarly, 1-indanone gives products 22 and 23 from this reaction sequence. Aza-and diazafluorenols also provide excellent yields of the Friedel-Crafts products (Scheme 2). When azafluorenol 24 is reacted with triflic acid and benzene, the substitution product 25 is obtained in nearly quantitative yield (eq 1). Likewise, the diazafluorenol 26 quantitatively gives the product from benzene (27). This compound was previously synthesized in 80% yield from 4,5-diazafluorene using a palladium-catalyzed procedure, as described in a patent related to its use in electroluminescent materials.9 High yields are also obtained from chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and 1-phenyldodecane, providing compounds 28 (o/p, 1:6), 29 (o/p, 1:6), and 30 (o/ p, 1:3), respectively. As in the case of alcohol 5, the diazafluorenol 26 does not react with good regioselectivity with monosubstituted benzenes. Diazafluorenols 31 and 33 are similarly found to give the Friedel-Crafts reaction products, 32 and 34, in excellent yields (eqs 4-5). Some N-heterocyclic alcohols are found to undergo rearrangement reactions in the superacid promoted con-versions (Scheme 3). When the cyclohexanol derivative 35 was reacted with triflic acid and benzene, phenylation occurs at the adjacent carbon to give 36 (eq 6). This transformation may be understood by assuming that compound 35 ionizes to the 1,3-dication 37. Migration of charge generates the 1,4-dication 38, a process driven by charge-charge repulsion, and this leads to the observed product 36. In a similar conversion, alcohol 39 gives product 40 in good yield (eq 7)�a conversion that is also explained by charge migration in the dication. Migration of charge may occur by either direct 1,2-hydride shift or by a deprotonation-reprotonation sequence. In order to determine which process is occurring, we prepared deuterium-labeled substrate 41 and the superacid-promoted reaction gave product 42 with the loss of deuterium (eq. 8). This conversion is the result of an equilibrium between the initially formed 1,3-dication 43, the intermediate from dedeuteration, and the 1,4-dication 44 from reprotonation. With a 2-adamantanol derivative (45), the Friedel-Crafts products 46-49 are formed in good yields and regioselectivities (eq 9). Upon heating to 50 °C with benzene, substrate 45 gives the Friedel-Crafts products (50) from reaction at the bridgehead carbon (eq 10). The analogous rearrangement products from chloro-and bromobenzene or toluene could not be obtained at 50 °C. The need for heating suggests a charge migration process involving a high energy intermediate. Assuming that the 1,3-dication 51 is the initially formed intermediate, charge migration by loss of a proton would give the strained bridgehead olefin 52 and reprotonation provides the 1,4-dication 53, which then gives product 50. The previously described Friedel-Crafts reactions also involve dicationic electrophiles (Scheme 4). For the 2-pyridyl system, the 1,3-dication (55), 1,4-dication (56), and 1,5-dication (57) were all capable of reacting with benzene� giving products 12-13 and 15 in nearly quantitative yields. Other N-heterocycles generated dicationic intermediates, including the quinolyl (57), imidazolyl (58), thiazolyl (59), and quinoxalyl (60) systems. In the synthetic reactions, 10 equiv of superacid was used. While it is assumed that the quinoxalyl system reacts through dication 60, the involvement of a tricationic intermediate cannot be excluded. The indanyl dication 62 was observed directly using low-temperature NMR and stable ion conditions. Thus, ionization of alcohol 22a in FSO3H-SbF5-SO2ClF at -78 °C provides a 13C NMR spectrum in which dication 62 is clearly visible (Figure 1). The carbocation 13C resonance is observed at δ 208.1, which suggests extensive delocalization of the positive charge into the adjacent aryl ring. This has been observed in other di-and tricationic systems.5a,h Charge-charge repulsive effects lead to strong resonance interactions with the π-electrons of the aryl ring. Efforts to observe the dicationic intermediate from 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5) were not successful. Ionization of this substrate in FSO3H-SbF5-SO2ClF at -78 °C gave a complex NMR spectrum. Unlike the indanyl system, ionization of 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5) does not benefit from stabilization of a benzylic carbocation center. Thus, a long-lived carbocation is not generated from 5. During the CF3SO3H-promoted Friedel-Crafts transformation (leading to products 6-11), a reactive dication is likely formed as a low-concentration transient species.  CONCLUSIONS In this study, we have found that N-heterocyclic alcohols react in excess superacid to generate reactive electrophilic intermediates capable of undergoing Friedel-Crafts reactions with arenes. The yields of these conversions are often nearly quantitative. The chemistry encompasses a wide variety of N-heterocycles and alcohol structures. Mechanisms are proposed which involve dicationic, superelectrophilic intermediates. These dicationic intermediates are likely in equilibrium with monoprotonated, olefinic N-heterocycles.  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Considerations. Condensation reactions were per-formed under an inert atmosphere using a thoroughly dried glassware. Products were isolated by flash chromatography using 60 Å silica gel. 1H and 13C NMR were carried out using either a 300 or 500 MHz spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra were obtained from a commercial analytical laboratory with a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer used for data collection. Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. Triflic acid was distilled prior to use and stored under a dry inert atmosphere. Structural assignments were made with additional information from gCOSY, gHSQC, and gHMBC experiments. SAFETY: triflic acid is highly corrosive�it should be handled in an efficient fume hood by appropriately trained individuals utilizing a personal protective gear. General Procedure A: Synthesis of Alcohols. The nitrogen heterocycle (1 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) at -78 °C, and n-butyllithium (0.44 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 1.76 mmol) was added dropwise using a syringe. After stirring for 1 h at -78 °C, 1.2 mmol ketone dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL, 0.24 M) was added slowly over a period of 30 min. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at -78 °C, and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature overnight. The reaction was quenched with ammonium chloride, and the product was extracted with chloroform (3 × 20 mL). The mixture was washed with brine, and the organic layer was separated and dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Flash column was performed with silica gel. General Procedure B: Synthesis of Alcohols. The N-heterocyclic carbonyl compound (1 mmol, 0.067 M) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) at -78 °C, and 1.2 equiv of Grignard or organolithium reagent (1.2 mmol) was added dropwise using a syringe. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at -78 °C, and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature overnight. The reaction was quenched with 1.0 M ammonium chloride, and the product was extracted with chloroform (3 × 20 mL). The mixture was washed with brine, and the organic layer was separated and dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Flash column is performed with silica gel. General Procedure C: Friedel-Crafts Reaction. The alcohol (0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL (0.1 M) of chloroform and added to the arene (5 mmol). Triflic acid (0.5 mL, 5.47 mmol, 11 equiv) was then added dropwise. After stirring for 15 h at room temperature, the product mixture was then quenched by pouring over 20 g of ice. The resulting mixture was adjusted to a pH of 10-11 using 10 M sodium hydroxide. After the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the mixture was extracted twice with chloroform. The combined organic extracts were subsequently washed with water and then with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under vacuum. Flash chromatography was performed with silica gel. 4-(2-Phenylpropan-2-yl)pyridine (6).

        "Jacob C. Hood, Maksim V. Anokhin, and Douglas A. Klumpp*ABSTRACT: N-Heterocyclic alcohols are shown to be excellent substrates for superacid-promoted Friedel-Crafts reactions. The N-heterocyclic alcohols ionize to produce reactive, dicationic intermediates which provide good to excellent yields of arylation products.",
        "INTRODUCTION Functionalized heterocyclic compounds are important syn-thetic targets. Roughly 70% of clinically useful pharmaceutical compounds contains one or more heterocyclic rings.1 Improved access to heterocyclic scaffolds can lower the costs of pharmaceutical intermediates and provide routes to new chemical space for drug development. Heterocyclic com-pounds are also useful in numerous other applications, such as materials science,2 agrochemicals,3 and dyes/pigments.4 Many important N-heterocyclic compounds contain aryl substituent groups�for example, pheniramine (an antihistamine drug), the fluorescent molecule used in an organic light-emitting diode, and boscalid (an antifungal agrochemical). While aryl substituents may be installed by a number of useful synthetic methods, our group has utilized dicationic electrophiles in the Friedel-Crafts reaction to prepare aryl-functionalized hetero-cycles and other products (1).5 For example, amino alcohols and olefinic N-heterocycles provide the arylated products (1 and 2) in excellent yields by reaction in superacidic CF3SO3H (triflic acid).5a,bThese conversions involve the formation of the super-electrophilic intermediates (3 and 4) which react readily with arene nucleophiles. Similarly, we demonstrated that N-heterocyclic alcohols may be ionized in superacid to give aza-polycyclic aromatic compounds, presumably through dications.5c An AlCl3-promoted transformation had been reported, giving phenylated products from an imidazole alcohol, and another arylation has been demonstrated with 2-hydroxymethylbenzimidazoles.6,7 Nevertheless, the use of N-heterocyclic alcohols in Friedel-Crafts reactions has not been widely employed. In the following manuscript, we describe the use of this synthetic methodology to prepare aryl-function-alized N-heterocycles. Mechanisms are proposed involving dicationic electrophilic intermediates.",
        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Our initial studies examined the reactions of 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5) in its reactions with triflic acid and arene nucleophiles (Scheme 1). When alcohol 5 is reacted with triflic acid (10 equiv) in the presence of benzene, a nearly quantitative yield of the Friedel-Crafts product (6) is© XXXX American Chemical Societyhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.3c00403 J. Org. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXXobtained.8 The conversion was not successful when weaker acids are used�H2SO4 or CF3CO2H�as there was no Friedel-Crafts reaction product detected at 25 °C. However, H2SO4 did provide a conversion to the elimination product, 4-(2-propenyl)pyridine. Using lower quantities of triflic acid likewise produced large amounts of 4-(2-propenyl)pyridine. With chloro-and bromobenzene, the arylated products (7-8) are obtained in good yields, while dichlorobenzenes lead to a significantly lower yield of the arylated products (9-10). Presumably, this is due to the deactivation of the aromatic ring by the chloro substituents. Although toluene provides the Friedel-Crafts product 11 in quantitative yield, it is formed as the mixture of regioisomers (like compounds 7 and 8). Theobserved product yields are consistent with the formation of reactive electrophiles, ones that is capable of reacting with deactivated arenes such dichlorobenzene.",
        "The Friedel-Crafts chemistry is found to be effective with a variety of N-heterocyclic alcohol substrates (Table 1). Like the 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5), the isomeric 2-(2-pyridyl)-2-propanol gives the corresponding phenylation product 12 in high yield. With increasing distance between the two sites of ionization, the chemistry remains highly effective. Thus, ionization of 4-(2-pyridyl)-2-methyl-2-butanol provides the phenylated product 15 four carbons away from the pyridine nitrogen. Other N-heterocycles give conversions to the respective Friedel-Crafts products, including quinolyl (16), imidazolyl (17), thioazolyl (18), and quinoxalyl (19). The quinoxalyl product is produced in lower yield because of its tendency to form an elimination product. Although the Friedel-Crafts chemistry did not show good regioselectivity with halogen-substituted benzenes (Scheme 1), a single regioisomer of the triarylethane (20) was prepared in good yield by installation of the 4-fluorophenyl group in the starting N-heterocyclic alcohol. Structurally diverse products may be prepared starting from cyclic ketones. For example, cyclo-hexanone provides the heterocyclic alcohol from 2-lithiopyr-idine, and the subsequent Friedel-Crafts reaction gives product 21. Similarly, 1-indanone gives products 22 and 23 from this reaction sequence.",
        "Aza-and diazafluorenols also provide excellent yields of the Friedel-Crafts products (Scheme 2). When azafluorenol 24 is reacted with triflic acid and benzene, the substitution product 25 is obtained in nearly quantitative yield (eq 1). Likewise, the diazafluorenol 26 quantitatively gives the product from benzene (27). This compound was previously synthesized in 80% yield from 4,5-diazafluorene using a palladium-catalyzed procedure, as described in a patent related to its use in electroluminescent materials.9 High yields are also obtained from chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and 1-phenyldodecane, providing compounds 28 (o/p, 1:6), 29 (o/p, 1:6), and 30 (o/ p, 1:3), respectively. As in the case of alcohol 5, the diazafluorenol 26 does not react with good regioselectivity with monosubstituted benzenes. Diazafluorenols 31 and 33 aresimilarly found to give the Friedel-Crafts reaction products, 32 and 34, in excellent yields (eqs 4-5).",
        "Some N-heterocyclic alcohols are found to undergo rearrangement reactions in the superacid promoted con-versions (Scheme 3). When the cyclohexanol derivative 35 was reacted with triflic acid and benzene, phenylation occurs at the adjacent carbon to give 36 (eq 6). This transformation may be understood by assuming that compound 35 ionizes to the 1,3-dication 37. Migration of charge generates the 1,4-dication 38, a process driven by charge-charge repulsion, and this leads to the observed product 36. In a similar conversion, alcohol 39 gives product 40 in good yield (eq 7)�a conversion that is also explained by charge migration in the dication. Migration of charge may occur by either direct 1,2-hydride shift or by a deprotonation-reprotonation sequence. In order to determine which process is occurring, we prepared deuterium-labeled substrate 41 and the superacid-promoted reaction gave product 42 with the loss of deuterium (eq. 8). This conversion is the result of an equilibrium between the initially formed 1,3-dication 43, the intermediate from dedeuteration, and the 1,4-dication 44 from reprotonation. With a 2-adamantanol derivative (45), the Friedel-Crafts products 46-49 are formed in good yields and regioselectivities (eq 9). Upon heating to 50 °C with benzene, substrate 45 gives the Friedel-Crafts products (50) from reaction at the bridgehead carbon (eq 10). The analogous rearrangement products from chloro-and bromobenzene or toluene could not be obtained at 50 °C. The need for heating suggests a charge migration process involving a high energy intermediate. Assuming that the 1,3-dication 51 is the initially formed intermediate, charge migration by loss of a proton would give the strained bridgehead olefin 52 and reprotonation provides the 1,4-dication 53, which then gives product 50.",
        "The previously described Friedel-Crafts reactions also involve dicationic electrophiles (Scheme 4). For the 2-pyridyl system, the 1,3-dication (55), 1,4-dication (56), and 1,5-dication (57) were all capable of reacting with benzene� giving products 12-13 and 15 in nearly quantitative yields. Other N-heterocycles generated dicationic intermediates, including the quinolyl (57), imidazolyl (58), thiazolyl (59), and quinoxalyl (60) systems. In the synthetic reactions, 10 equiv of superacid was used. While it is assumed that the quinoxalyl system reacts through dication 60, the involvement of a tricationic intermediate cannot be excluded.",
        "The indanyl dication 62 was observed directly using low-temperature NMR and stable ion conditions. Thus, ionization of alcohol 22a in FSO3H-SbF5-SO2ClF at -78 °C provides a 13C NMR spectrum in which dication 62 is clearly visible (Figure 1). The carbocation 13C resonance is observed at δ 208.1, which suggests extensive delocalization of the positive charge into the adjacent aryl ring. This has been observed in other di-and tricationic systems.5a,h Charge-charge repulsive effects lead to strong resonance interactions with the π-electrons of the aryl ring. Efforts to observe the dicationic intermediate from 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5) were not successful. Ionization of this substrate in FSO3H-SbF5-SO2ClF at -78 °C gave a complex NMR spectrum. Unlike the indanyl system, ionization of 2-(4-pyridyl)-2-propanol (5) does not benefit from stabilization of a benzylic carbocation center. Thus, a long-lived carbocation is not generated from 5. During the CF3SO3H-promoted Friedel-Crafts transformation (leading to products 6-11), a reactive dication is likely formed as a low-concentration transient species.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In this study, we have found that N-heterocyclic alcohols react in excess superacid to generate reactive electrophilic intermediates capable of undergoing Friedel-Crafts reactions with arenes. The yields of these conversions are often nearly quantitative. The chemistry encompasses a wide variety of N-heterocycles and alcohol structures. Mechanisms are proposed which involve dicationic, superelectrophilic intermediates. These dicationic intermediates are likely in equilibrium with monoprotonated, olefinic N-heterocycles.",
        "General Considerations. Condensation reactions were per-formed under an inert atmosphere using a thoroughly dried glassware.",
        "Products were isolated by flash chromatography using 60 Å silica gel. 1H and 13C NMR were carried out using either a 300 or 500 MHz spectrometer.
