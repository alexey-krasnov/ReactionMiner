Oxazolidine derivatives were generated in the presence of chloro benziodoxole and TFA, while dihydroxazines were formed without a hypervalent iodine reagent. The reaction was performed under room temperature and gave the products in good to excellent yields.  INTRODUCTION Oxazolidine and dihydroxazine derivatives are widely dis-tributed in many valuable drug candidates and other biologically active compounds.1,2 They also have been used as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Con-sequently, a number of methods for the construction of oxazolidine and dihydroxazine have been developed in the past several decades. Condensation of 1,2-aminol alcohols with aldehydes, ketones, or alkenes is a convenient method to form an oxazolidine ring.3 Oxazolidines could also be prepared by [3 + 2] cycloaddition of aziridines with aldehydes or epoxides with imines.4 1,1-Difunctionalization of alkenes is another efficient method to synthesize oxazolidines.5 Dihydroxazine could be prepared via the reaction between protected amino acids and carbonyl compounds.6 The synthesis also could be achieved through a hydroamination of alkynes7 or a reaction between triazoles and halohydrins.8 Recent decades have witnessed prosperous development of hypervalent iodine reagents and their applications in modern organic synthesis.9 Hypervalent iodine reagents possess very attractive characteristics, including the ready availability, mild reaction conditions, and environmental benignity.10 Novel hypervalent iodine reagents have not only been used in oxidative reactions but also play an essential role in many other synthetic transformations. For example, Rehbein et al. disclosed the regiodivergent synthesis of indoles and tryptophans mediated by hypervalent iodine reagent 1 through C,H-amination (Scheme 1a).11 The fluorocyclization of allylaminoethanol could be realized by a hypervalent fluoroiodine reagent (Scheme 1b).12 The chiral hypervalent iodine reagents have also been developed for the enantiose-lective dearomatization of phenols (Scheme 1c).13 In the past several years, our group have been engaged in the hypervalent iodine reagent-mediated transformation of alkenes to construct functionalized heterocycles.12,14 Herein, we reported the synthesis of oxazolidines from α-aminated ketones in the presence of TFA and chloro benziodoxole 2. Dihydroxazines were obtained without the addition of hypervalent iodine reagent (Scheme 1d).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initially, we performed the reaction by using N-(2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)-4-methyl-N-(2-oxo-2-phenyleth-yl) benzenesulfonamide 4a as substrate in the presence of TFA and PhI(OAc)2 in dichloromethane at room temperature for 4 h. The product oxazolidine 5a was obtained in 32% yield (Table 1, entry 1). We then examined the hypervalent iodine reagents for this transformation (entries 2-5). The yield of product could be improved to 79% when bis(trifluoroacetic acid)iodobenzene (PIFA) was employed. The reaction proceeded smoothly when benziodoxole 1-3 were used; especially the use of benziodoxole 2 afforded the product in quantitative yield. We also performed the reaction in other solvents; no product was obtained with acetone, DMF, MeCN, THF, or Et2O, and moderated yield was obtained in toluene (entries 6-12). The reaction in chloroform gave the same result as in dichloromethane (entry 8).

With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we then examined the scope of α-aminated ketones with different substituents (Scheme 2). First, we explored the substrates in which R1 is a substituted phenyl group, and R2 and R3 are hydrogen-substituted compounds. The substrates with elec-tron-donating groups at the 4-and 2-positions of the benzene ring, such as methyl and methoxy, underwent the reaction smoothly to generate the products 5b-5d in great yields of 95-98%. Halogen substituents such as fluoro, chloro, and bromo could be tolerated under the reaction conditions. The substrates with substituents at the 2-, 3-, or 4-position of benzene ring participated in this reaction and gave the desired products 5e-5i in 89-93% yields. In addition, the substrate with the p-cyanophenyl group provided the oxazolidine product in 92% yield (5j). Substrates with 2-thienyl and 2-furyl groups underwent the reaction and furnished the products 5k and 5l in 96 and 67% yields, respectively. The reactivity was the same as model reaction when R1 is a biphenyl or 2-naphthyl substituent (5m and 5n). When R1 was a methyl group, the reactivity of the substrate significantly reduced, affording the product 5o in 73% yield. Next, we investigated the substrates in which R1 was a phenyl group. The substrates exhibited excellent reactivity when R2 was a phenyl or benzyl group (5p and 5q). However, product formation was slightly inhibited when R2 was an alkyl group (5r and 5s). However, when R3 was a methyl group, the desired product could be obtained in almost quantitative yield (5t). We tried to increase the carbon number of amino alcohol and found that a six-membered ring product could be obtained in 99% yield (5u). No seven-membered ring product was observed by further increasing the carbon number of the substrate. When the substrate 4a subjected to the reaction conditions without hypervalent iodine reagent, no oxazolidine product was observed, and dihydroxazine 6a was obtained in quantitative yield. We further examined the substrate scope of substituted α-aminated ketone 4a under the reaction conditions to form dihydroxazine derivatives (Scheme 3). The electron-donating groups such as methyl and methoxyl tolerated well under the reaction conditions and afforded the desired products in good yields (6b and 6c). With the substituents at the ortho-or meta-position, the reaction proceeded well and gave the dihydroxazine products in good to excellent yields (6d, 6h, and 6i). The substrates with a halogen atom underwent the reaction smoothly to provide dihydroxazines in ca. 80% yields (6e-6g). When the functional group cyano was introduced to the substrate, the reaction proceeded and gave the corresponding product in 88% yield (6j). The reactivity of the substrate bearing a biphenyl group was similar to model reaction (6m). The substrate with a 2-naphthyl or 2-thienyl substituent underwent the reaction efficiently, and the products were obtained in excellent yields (6n and 6k). The reaction became sluggish when a furan group was introduced to the substrate (6l). The R2 group of the substrate, which was phenyl or benzyl, exhibited good reactivity and afforded the corresponding products in quantitative yields (6p and 6q). When R2 or R3 was the alkyl substituent, the reaction occurred and provided dihydroxazine derivatives in 82-95% yields (6r-6v). The extension of the carbon chain inhibited the formation of the dihydroxazine product. Based on the results and our previous work14 of hypervalent iodine reagents, we proposed the reaction pathway for the synthesis of oxazolidines and dihydroxazines (Scheme 4). The substrate 4a undergoes deprotection to generate intermediate A in the presence of TFA. The C-C double bond of the enol attacks chloro benziodoxole 2 to form intermediate B through the four-membered-ring transition state. The cyclization occurs with the elimination of aryl iodine to give intermediate C. Finally, formation of ketone 5a occurs by leaving the chloride ion. If the reaction takes place without a hypervalent iodine reagent, after deprotection of the substrate with TFA, a nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group to the carbonyl group occurs to form ketal E. Then, dehydration of intermediate E happens to generate product 6a.  CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of oxazolidines and dihydroxazines from α-aminated ketones under mild reaction conditions. The formation of oxazolidine or dihydroxazine products is determined by the addition of a hypervalent iodine reagent or not. A variety of functional groups could be tolerated in the reaction conditions. This transformation presents a practical procedure to deliver multi-substituted oxazolidine and dihydroxazine products.  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Methods. Unless otherwise noted, all commercially available reagents and solvents were used without further purification. Column chromatography was generally performed on silica gel (200-300 mesh), and reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatog-raphy (TLC) using silica gel GF254 plates with UV light to visualize the course of reaction. Melting points were determined on a ShenGuang WRS-2 melting point apparatus. The 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 (internal standard: 7.26 ppm, 1H; 77.0 ppm, 13C) using a Bruker AV-300 (300 MHz) or AV-400 (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer. The chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) in Hz. High-resolution mass data (HRMS) were obtained using the ESI technique. The hypervalent iodine reagent 215 and substrates 416 were prepared according to literature procedures with some modification. Procedure for the Synthesis of 4a.

        "Synthesis of Oxazolidines and Dihydroxazines via Cyclization of α‑Aminated Ketones",
        "ABSTRACT: A new approach to oxazolidines and dihydroxazines was developed by regioselective cyclization of α-aminated ketones under transition metal-free conditions. Oxazolidine derivatives were generated in the presence of chloro benziodoxole and TFA, while dihydroxazines were formed without a hypervalent iodine reagent. The reaction was performed under room temperature and gave the products in good to excellent yields.",
        "INTRODUCTION Oxazolidine and dihydroxazine derivatives are widely dis-tributed in many valuable drug candidates and other biologically active compounds.1,2 They also have been used as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Con-sequently, a number of methods for the construction of oxazolidine and dihydroxazine have been developed in the past several decades. Condensation of 1,2-aminol alcohols with aldehydes, ketones, or alkenes is a convenient method to form an oxazolidine ring.3 Oxazolidines could also be prepared by [3 + 2] cycloaddition of aziridines with aldehydes or epoxides with imines.4 1,1-Difunctionalization of alkenes is another efficient method to synthesize oxazolidines.5 Dihydroxazine could be prepared via the reaction between protected amino acids and carbonyl compounds.6 The synthesis also could be achieved through a hydroamination of alkynes7 or a reaction between triazoles and halohydrins.8Recent decades have witnessed prosperous development of hypervalent iodine reagents and their applications in modern organic synthesis.9 Hypervalent iodine reagents possess very attractive characteristics, including the ready availability, mild reaction conditions, and environmental benignity.10 Novel hypervalent iodine reagents have not only been used in oxidative reactions but also play an essential role in many other synthetic transformations. For example, Rehbein et al. disclosed the regiodivergent synthesis of indoles and tryptophans mediated by hypervalent iodine reagent 1 through C,H-amination (Scheme 1a).11 The fluorocyclization of allylaminoethanol could be realized by a hypervalent fluoroiodine reagent (Scheme 1b).12 The chiral hypervalent iodine reagents have also been developed for the enantiose-lective dearomatization of phenols (Scheme 1c).13In the past several years, our group have been engaged in the hypervalent iodine reagent-mediated transformation of alkenes to construct functionalized heterocycles.12,14 Herein, we reported the synthesis of oxazolidines from α-aminated ketones in the presence of TFA and chloro benziodoxole 2. Dihydroxazines were obtained without the addition of hypervalent iodine reagent (Scheme 1d).",
        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initially, we performed the reaction by using N-(2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)-4-methyl-N-(2-oxo-2-phenyleth-yl) benzenesulfonamide 4a as substrate in the presence of TFA and PhI(OAc)2 in dichloromethane at room temperature for 4 h. The product oxazolidine 5a was obtained in 32% yield (Table 1, entry 1). We then examined the hypervalent iodine reagents for this transformation (entries 2-5). The yield of product could be improved to 79% when bis(trifluoroacetic acid)iodobenzene (PIFA) was employed. The reaction proceeded smoothly when benziodoxole 1-3 were used; especially the use of benziodoxole 2 afforded the product in quantitative yield. We also performed the reaction in other solvents; no product was obtained with acetone, DMF, MeCN, THF, or Et2O, and moderated yield was obtained in toluene (entries 6-12). The reaction in chloroform gave the same result as in dichloromethane (entry 8). When hypervalent© XXXX American Chemical Societyhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.3c00690 J. Org. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXXiodine reagent was omitted, the reaction provided dihydrox-azine product 6a instead of 5a (entry 13).",
        "With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we then examined the scope of α-aminated ketones with different substituents (Scheme 2). First, we explored the substrates inwhich R1 is a substituted phenyl group, and R2 and R3 are hydrogen-substituted compounds. The substrates with elec-tron-donating groups at the 4-and 2-positions of the benzene ring, such as methyl and methoxy, underwent the reaction smoothly to generate the products 5b-5d in great yields of 95-98%. Halogen substituents such as fluoro, chloro, and bromo could be tolerated under the reaction conditions. The substrates with substituents at the 2-, 3-, or 4-position of benzene ring participated in this reaction and gave the desired products 5e-5i in 89-93% yields. In addition, the substrate with the p-cyanophenyl group provided the oxazolidine product in 92% yield (5j). Substrates with 2-thienyl and 2-furyl groups underwent the reaction and furnished the products 5k and 5l in 96 and 67% yields, respectively. The reactivity was the same as model reaction when R1 is a biphenyl or 2-naphthyl substituent (5m and 5n). When R1 was a methyl group, the reactivity of the substrate significantly reduced, affording the product 5o in 73% yield. Next, we investigated the substrates in which R1 was a phenyl group. The substrates exhibited excellent reactivity when R2 was aphenyl or benzyl group (5p and 5q). However, product formation was slightly inhibited when R2 was an alkyl group (5r and 5s). However, when R3 was a methyl group, the desired product could be obtained in almost quantitative yield (5t). We tried to increase the carbon number of amino alcohol and found that a six-membered ring product could be obtained in 99% yield (5u). No seven-membered ring product was observed by further increasing the carbon number of the substrate.",
        "When the substrate 4a subjected to the reaction conditions without hypervalent iodine reagent, no oxazolidine product was observed, and dihydroxazine 6a was obtained in quantitative yield. We further examined the substrate scope of substituted α-aminated ketone 4a under the reaction conditions to form dihydroxazine derivatives (Scheme 3). The electron-donating groups such as methyl and methoxyl tolerated well under the reaction conditions and afforded the desired products in good yields (6b and 6c). With the substituents at the ortho-or meta-position, the reaction proceeded well and gave the dihydroxazine products in good to excellent yields (6d, 6h, and 6i). The substrates with a halogen atom underwent the reaction smoothly to provide dihydroxazines in ca. 80% yields (6e-6g). When the functional group cyano was introduced to the substrate, the reaction proceeded and gave the corresponding product in 88% yield (6j). The reactivity of the substrate bearing a biphenyl group was similar to model reaction (6m). The substrate with a 2-naphthyl or 2-thienyl substituent underwent the reaction efficiently, and the products were obtained in excellent yields (6n and 6k). The reaction became sluggish when a furan group was introduced to the substrate (6l). The R2 group of the substrate, which was phenyl or benzyl, exhibited good reactivity and afforded the corresponding products in quantitative yields (6p and 6q). When R2 or R3 was the alkyl substituent, the reaction occurred and provided dihydroxazine derivatives in 82-95% yields (6r-6v). The extension of the carbon chain inhibited the formation of the dihydroxazine product.",
        "Based on the results and our previous work14 of hypervalent iodine reagents, we proposed the reaction pathway for the synthesis of oxazolidines and dihydroxazines (Scheme 4). Thesubstrate 4a undergoes deprotection to generate intermediate A in the presence of TFA. The C-C double bond of the enol attacks chloro benziodoxole 2 to form intermediate B through the four-membered-ring transition state. The cyclization occurs with the elimination of aryl iodine to give intermediate C. Finally, formation of ketone 5a occurs by leaving the chloride ion. If the reaction takes place without a hypervalent iodine reagent, after deprotection of the substrate with TFA, a nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group to the carbonyl group occurs to form ketal E. Then, dehydration of intermediate E happens to generate product 6a.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of oxazolidines and dihydroxazines from α-aminated ketones under mild reaction conditions. The formation of oxazolidine or dihydroxazine products is determined by the addition of a hypervalent iodine reagent or not. A variety of functional groups could be tolerated in the reaction conditions. This transformation presents a practical procedure to deliver multi-substituted oxazolidine and dihydroxazine products.",
        "General Methods. Unless otherwise noted, all commercially available reagents and solvents were used without further purification. Column chromatography was generally performed on silica gel (200-300 mesh), and reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatog-raphy (TLC) using silica gel GF254 plates with UV light to visualize the course of reaction. Melting points were determined on a ShenGuang WRS-2 melting point apparatus. The 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 (internal standard: 7.26 ppm, 1H; 77.0 ppm, 13C) using a Bruker AV-300 (300 MHz) or AV-400 (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer. The chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) in Hz. High-resolution mass data (HRMS) were obtained using the ESI technique. The hypervalent iodine reagent 215 and substrates 416 were prepared according to literature procedures with some modification.",
