Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the reaction mechanism reveal that the former reaction proceeds through the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling, propargyl-allenyl isomerization (1,3-H transfer) and [2 + 2] cycloaddition, whereas the latter involves a process of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling, a propargylic Alder-ene-type reaction (1,8-H transfer) and 6π-electrocyclization leading to the formation of the formal [4 + 2] cycloadducts. The divergent formation of two types of allenic intermediates depending on propargylic substrates is confirmed and elucidated. KEYWORDS: tandem reaction, propargyl-allenyl isomerization, Alder-ene reaction, allene, cycloaddition  INTRODUCTION Allenes have attracted numerous attention in synthetic organic chemistry in recent years due to their rich properties and versatile reactivities.1-7 In particular, the relatively high-energy profile and unique geometry of allenes arising from the cumulated diene structural moieties render them valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of complex carbo-and heterocyclic backbones via diversified cyclization reactions.8-17 Moreover, allenes are also frequently engaged as reactive intermediates in reaction design for rapid construction of cyclic frameworks that usually cannot be easily obtained from traditional methods.18-23 Based on a facile and convenient palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling and base-promoted propargyl-allenyl isomerization reactions (CIRs, Scheme 1a), for example, Müller and we have developed a series of tandem transformations of the in situ generated vinyl-allene intermediates I, such as Diels-Alder reaction,24-28 Alder-ene reaction,29 Claisen rearrangement,30-32 [3 + 2] azide-olefin cycloaddition,33 and Schmittel cyclization,34 to afford a diversity of useful skeletons.35-39 As our further endeavor, we recently postulated (1) the possible formation of an aryl-tethered heteroatom-substituted allene-ynone intermediate II from the CIR of an ortho-iodophenyl-ynone and a propargylic substrate and questioned (2) the reactivity of such a functionalized allenic intermediate for cyclization reactions (initial design, Scheme 1b). It is worth noting that previous studies on cyclization reactions of relevant yne-allenes have proven extreme success in the synthesis of a variety of cyclic skeletons via cycloadditions,40-42 cycloisomerizations,43 and other annulations44 upon thermal or photochemical initiation Received: February 23, 2023 Revised: April 24, 2023 Published: June 9, 2023 Research Articlepubs.acs.org/acscatalysis © 2023 American Chemical Society 8402 https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c00857 ACS Catal. 2023, 13, 8402-8412 D ow nl oa de d vi a U N IV  IL L IN O IS  UR B A N A -C H A M PA IG N  on Ju ly  21,  202 3 at  00: 23 :5 3 (U T C ).

The two different types of allenic intermediates then fulfill formal [2 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloadditions with high selectivity to provide polycyclic compounds of cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)-one and 11H-benzo[b]fluoren-11-one backbones, respectively (this finding, Scheme 1b). Here, we report the details on the development of these types of palladium-catalyzed tandem reactions involving divergent formation of allene intermediates with consecutive cyclizations, as well as a combined experimental and theoretical study to illustrate the reaction mechanism and the origin of the observed selectivity.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Reaction Discovery and Optimization. We initially explored the reactions of 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-one (1a), with propargyl tosylamide 2a and propargyl benzyl ether 3a under the palladium catalysis in the presence of an excessive base, which was expected to facilitate the cross-coupling reaction and promote the propargyl-allenyl isomer-ization. The preliminary experiments showed that 1a coupled with 2a in the presence of 5 mol % Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, 10 mol % CuI and diisopropylamine (DIPA) to form the alkynylation intermediate, which was finally converted to a cyclobuta[b]-naphthalen-3(1H)-one product 4a in 40% yield as the product (Table 1, entry 1). In contrast, the reaction of 1a and 3a under similar reaction conditions gave rise to a skeletally different product, i.e., 5-benzoyl-11H-benzo[b]fluoren-11-one (5a) in 50% yield (Table 1, entry 15). Encouraged by these intriguing results, we next performed a series of optimization experiments by varying reaction parameters including the palladium catalyst, base, solvent, reaction temperature, and molar ratios of the substrates to improve the product yields (for detailed results, see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). It was found that the combination of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI with an excess DIPA as the base in toluene was the best system for both reactions. The optimal conditions were obtained as follows: the reaction of 1a and 2a (2/1 molar ratio) with 5 mol % Pd(PPh3)4 and 10 mol % CuI in toluene/ DIPA at 60 °C for 6 h gave 4a in 71% yield (Table 1, entry 11); and the reaction of 1a and 3a (1/1.2 molar ratio) with 5 mol % Pd(PPh3)4 and 10 mol % CuI in toluene/DIPA at 60 °C for 3 h produced 5a in 73% yield (Table 1, entry 26). Reaction Scope. With the optimal conditions in hand, the scopes of the two reactions were investigated (Table 2). Thus, 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ones bearing R1 sub-stituents as MeO, Cl, Br, and CF3 were all competent substrates to yield the corresponding products (4a-4i). The incorporation of an electron-withdrawing group R1 (CF3) leads to a decreased product yield as indicated from the results of 4e. In contrast, electronic nature of the R2 group has little impact on the reaction, and the products 4f-4i were all obtained in moderate to good yields (55-68%). Regarding propargyl tosylamides 2, R3 substituents including p-Me, p-MeO, p-Cl, and p-Br were tolerated to furnish products 4j-4m in moderate to good yields. The reaction of a naphthanenyl-derived substrate was also applicable, albeit producing 4n in a low yield. In addition, the performance of propargyl benzenesulfonamide and propargyl o-nitrobenzenesulfonamide were checked, and the reactions gave the products 4o and 4p in 75% and 45% yields, respectively. Noted that the reaction of 1-(2-iodocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-one failed to generate the expected product 4q. The structure of 4a was further characterized by an X-ray diffraction study. The reactions of various 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ones 1 with propargylic benzyl ethers 2 were also evaluated (Table 2, right column). 1-(2-Iodophenyl)-3-phenyl-prop-2-yn-1-ones 1 bearing R1 substituents as Me, MeO, Cl, and even the Br atom all reacted smoothly with 3a, to afford the corresponding products 5a-5e in 38-73% yields. Varied R2 substituents like Et, Cl, MeO, CN, and CF3 were allowed to give the expected products 5f-5j, 5r in 57-78% yields. Several variants on R3 like p-Cl, p-MeO, and o-MeO groups in propargyl benzyl ethers 3 were examined, and the reactions gave the expected products (5k-5m, 5o-5t) in good to high yields. It is notable that the incorporation of the electron-donating p-MeO group as R3 gave the products high yields (5l and 5t). However, the reaction of a 2-thiophenyl substrate with 1a gave the product 5n in a low yield (37%). Similarly, 1-(2-iodocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-one was not a suitable substrate to give the desired product 5u. The structure of 5h was further determined by an X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis unambiguously. Mechanism Study. The distinguished chemoselectivity of the above reactions clearly suggests remarkably different reactivities between the oxygen-and nitrogen-substituted alkyne-ynone intermediates engaged in the reactions. Thus, a series of control experiments were conducted to probe the reaction mechanism. As shown in Scheme 2, the Pd/Cu-catalyzed reaction of 1a and 2a performed at room temperature for 1.5 h afforded the cross-coupling product 6a in 90% yield. Treatment of 6a with DIPA in toluene for 6 h afforded 4a in 76-82% yield, while the reaction in the absence of DIPA did not give 4a (Scheme 2, eqs 1-3). In addition, it was observed that the presence of radical scavengers, i.e., 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, butylated hydroxytoluene, and 1,1-diphenylethene, led to a significant loss of product yield of 4a (Scheme 2, eq 4). On the other hand, the cross-coupling intermediate 6b from 1a and 3a was also isolated. Heating of 6b with toluene affords 5a in 75% yield (Scheme 2, eq 4). We also checked the reactions in the presence of the stronger base, i.e., DBU. It was found that a catalytic amount of DBU promoted the transformation of 6b into the cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)-one 5a″ in 35% yield (Scheme 2, eq 6).64 These results imply that the acidity of propargylic C-H in the alkyne-ynone intermediate (6a/6b) may play a critical role in the selectivity of the reaction. Moreover, it was found that the presence of radical scavengers did not shut down the transformation, suggesting that a free radical pathway is unlikely for the reaction (Scheme 2, eq 7). In addition, the detection of PhCH2OH by GC/MS analysis of the reaction mixture indicated the involvement of a hydrolysis step for the formation of the final product 5a. The labeling studies using deuterated substrates were performed to further gain insights into the mechanism (Scheme 3). The reaction of 1a and 2a-d gave 4a-d1 in 68% yield, in which only ca. 53% content of D was observed at C(8) (Scheme 3, eq 1). The significant loss of D content supports the notion that H/D exchange takes place in the DIPA-assisted propargyl-allenyl isomerization step (Scheme 5, vide infra). Conducting the reaction using the aprotonic Et3N as the base afforded 4a-d2 in which 84% D was incorporated, further supporting this assumption (Scheme 3, eq 2). On the other hand, the reaction of 1a and 3a-d under the optimal conditions produced 5a-d in 65% yield. 1H NMR analysis of this product showed that about 78% content of the D atom was incorporated into the C(10) position, almost consistent with the D content of 3a-d at the propargylic carbon (Scheme 3, eq 3). This result led us to postulate that a direct 1,8-H transfer of the cross-coupling intermediate 6b might take place during the reaction to form a different allenic intermediate (like species 15-Z in Scheme 5, vide infra) to fulfill the sequence. To verify the above hypothesis, we performed the reactions of 1a with allyl-substituted propargyl ethers 7a and 7b to capture the possible intermediates. Gratifyingly, both reactions proceeded smoothly under the optimal conditions and gave rise to the fused pentacyclic and tetracyclic products 8a and 8b with excellent diastereoselectivity in 54 and 80% yield, respectively (Scheme 4). The structure of 8a was unambigu-ously confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study. The product 8b was fully characterized by NMR spectra including COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC. It was interestingly observed that H(Ph) atoms of the indanone moiety in compound 8b show NMR signals at a relatively high field probably because of the shielding effect of the remote phenyl ring incorporated at the 2,3-dihydrofuran moiety. The formation of these products thus can be rationalized by a process of intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction of the enone-allene intermediate 10/12, generated from a propargylic Alder-ene-type reaction of 9/11. At this stage, the plausible mechanism of the reaction was proposed (Scheme 5). The Pd/Cu-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction first generates the coupling intermediate. In the case of propargyl tosylamide 2a as the coupling partner, the cross-coupling intermediate 6a undergoes DIPA-assisted propargyl-allenyl isomerization to form an ynone-allene intermediate 14. The isomerization should proceed through an ion-pair intermediacy 13, as indicated by the deuterium-labeled experiments (Scheme 5, eqs 1 and 2). Subsequent intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 14 furnishes the product 4a. When propargyl benzyl ether 3a was employed as the coupling partner, the resulted intermediate 6b may undergo a propargylic Alder-ene-type reaction to give a cyclized enone-allene intermediate 15-Z. This step may be influenced by the sterically hindering effect of a substitute ortho to the carbonyl group in substrate 1, which is indicated by a low yield of 5e (Table 2). Subsequent 6π-electrocyclization forms a fused tetracyclic intermediate 16. Successive hydrolysis of the vinyl ether motif and aromatization finally form 5a. To validate the mechanism of the cycloaddition step to reveal the substituent-controlled chemoselectivity, we con-ducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the M06/6-311 + G(d,p)-SDD/SMD(toluene)//M06/6-31G(d)-SDD/SMD(toluene) level of theory. As shown in Figure 1, 1,6-diynes 6a and 6b, in situ generated from Sonogashira coupling, were chosen as the starting species in our theoretical study. In this type of diyne, the acidity of the propargylic hydrogen plays an important role in chemoselectivity. Either base-assisted 1,3-hydrogen transfer or Alder-ene-type hydrogen transfer could occur to achieve different transformations, which would depend on the neighboring substituent group. As shown in Figure 1a, 6a was chosen as relative zero in calculated free energy profiles. The [2 + 2] cycloaddition could start from a DIPA-assisted intramolecular 1,3-hydrogen transfer. The DIPA-promoted deprotonation of 6a at the propargyl position could occur to generate an allenyl anion species 13 via transition state TS-1. The calculated activation free energy is 25.4 kcal/mol for this process, which would be the rate-determining step. Subsequent re-protonation of the allenyl carbon in 13 could achieve 1,3-hydrogen transfer to generate the ynone-allene intermediate 14. The following [2 + 2] cycloaddition could take place through a stepwise pathway.65 The formation of the first C-C bond could occur to generate the diradical intermediate 17 via a close-shell transition state TS-3 with a free energy barrier of 20.7 kcal/mol. The radical-radical coupling takes place via an open-shell singlet transition state TS-4 to yield the product 4a in a highly exergonic step. The competitive intramolecular Alder-ene-type pathway was also considered. As shown in Figure 1a (left part), the Alder-ene-type hydrogen transfer would occur via transition state TS-5 with a free energy barrier of 26.7 kcal/mol to provide the enone-allene intermediate 18-Z for further transformations. The calculated activation free energy of this step is 1.3 kcal/ mol higher than that of DIPA-assisted 1,3-hydrogen transfer. Therefore, a stepwise process of 1,3-hydrogen transfer followed by [2 + 2] cycloaddition is preferred. On the other hand, DFT calculation revealed that the deprotonation of 1,6-diyne 6b needs to traverse a free energy barrier of 28.4 kcal/mol via proton transfer transition state TS-11 (Figure 1b). The free energy barrier of this step is 3.0 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding step using propargyl sulfonamido substituted 1,6-diyne 6a. It means the deprotonation of 6b is difficult compared with 6a. Based on this observation, we considered the alternative intramolecular Alder-ene-type reaction of 6b. DFT calculation clearly revealed that the free energy barrier of Alder-ene-type reaction via transition state TS-6 is 25.8 kcal/ mol, which is 2.6 kcal/mol lower than that of deprotonation via transition state TS-11. Therefore, Alder-ene-type reaction would take precedence over deprotonation, which leads to different chemoselectivity. The Alder-ene reaction gives an enone-allene intermediate 15-Z with exergonic energy of 38.9 kcal/mol leading to an irreversible process. Subsequently, the copper-promoted cis-trans isomerization occurs, eventually resulting in the generation of 15-E. This isomerization process is endothermic by 1.3 kcal mol-1, with an overall activation free energy of 19.2 kcal mol-1. The subsequent pericyclic 6π-electrocyclic reaction takes place via transition state TS-8, which reversibly provides a dearomatized benzofluorenone intermediate 16. Then, hydrolysis of vinyl ether moiety results in a ketone intermediate 19, which could undergo a dehydrogenation to achieve aromatization and yield the product 5a (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). DFT calculation clearly revealed that the chemoselectivity is determined by the acidity of propargyl hydrogen in the 1,6-diyne molecule. We calculated the acidity of intermediate 6a and 6b using B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)/IEFPCM(DMSO)// B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.66-70 We found that the pKa of 6a is 9.8, which is 0.9 lower than that of 6b, which could be attributed to the substituent effect. Therefore, 5a would be the major product when 6b is used as the reactant. Our DFT calculations are in complete agreement with experimental observation.  CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we have reported two sets of palladium-catalyzed tandem reactions involving cross-coupling, allene formation, and formal [2 + 2] or [4 + 2] cycloaddition, thereby providing a rapid synthesis of polycyclic compounds bearing cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)-one and 5-benzoyl-11H-benzo[b]fluoren-11-one skeletons. The method has advantages such as the use of readily available starting materials, operational simplicity, catalytic conditions, and high selectivity. Mechanism studies indicated that the reactions involved the generation of two different types of allenic intermediates, i.e., ynone-allenes via propargyl-allenyl isomerization (1,3-hydro-gen transfer) and enone-allenes via the propargylic ene-type reaction (1,8-hydrogen transfer), from the corresponding cross-coupling intermediates. Detailed computational calcu-lations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and provide insights on the origin of the selectivity of the reactions. Ongoing efforts are currently directed to further expanding the scope and applications of the methodology.

        "Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling, Divergent Allene Generation, and Cycloadditions toward Cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)‑ones and 11H-Benzo[b]fluoren-11-ones",
        "ABSTRACT: The Pd-catalyzed reaction of 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-arylprop-2-yn-1-ones with propargyl sulfonamide produces cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)-ones, while the reaction of 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-arylprop-2-yn-1-ones with propargyl ethers under the similar palladium catalysis affords 11H-benzo[b]fluoren-11-ones as products. Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the reaction mechanism reveal that the former reaction proceeds through the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling, propargyl-allenyl isomerization (1,3-H transfer) and [2 + 2] cycloaddition, whereas the latter involves a process of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling, a propargylic Alder-ene-type reaction (1,8-H transfer) and 6π-electrocyclization leading to the formation of the formal [4 + 2] cycloadducts. The divergent formation of two types of allenic intermediates depending on propargylic substrates is confirmed and elucidated. KEYWORDS: tandem reaction, propargyl-allenyl isomerization, Alder-ene reaction, allene, cycloadditionINTRODUCTION Allenes have attracted numerous attention in synthetic organic chemistry in recent years due to their rich properties and versatile reactivities.1-7 In particular, the relatively high-energy profile and unique geometry of allenes arising from the cumulated diene structural moieties render them valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of complex carbo-and heterocyclic backbones via diversified cyclization reactions.8-17 Moreover, allenes are also frequently engaged as reactive intermediates in reaction design for rapid construction of cyclic frameworks that usually cannot be easily obtained from traditional methods.18-23 Based on a facile and convenient palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling and base-promoted propargyl-allenyl isomerization reactions (CIRs, Scheme 1a), for example, Müller and we have developed a series of tandem transformations of the in situ generated vinyl-allene intermediates I, such as Diels-Alder reaction,24-28 Alder-ene reaction,29 Claisen rearrangement,30-32 [3 + 2] azide-olefin cycloaddition,33 and Schmittel cyclization,34 to afford a diversity of useful skeletons.35-39 As our further endeavor, we recently postulated (1) the possible formation of an aryl-tethered heteroatom-substituted allene-ynone intermediate II from the CIR of an ortho-iodophenyl-ynone and a propargylic substrate and questioned (2) the reactivity of such a functionalized allenic intermediate for cyclization reactions (initial design, Scheme 1b). It is worth noting that previous studies on cyclization reactions of relevant yne-allenes have proven extreme success in the synthesis of a variety of cyclic skeletons via cycloadditions,40-42 cycloisomerizations,43 and other annulations44 upon thermal or photochemical initiation© 2023 American Chemical Societyand Lewis acid or transition metal catalysis.45-59 However, the reactivity on aryl-tethered ynone-allenes has been less explored, and their synthetic utilities remain to be exploited.60During the course of this project, we discovered that the cross-coupling intermediates from ortho-iodophenyl-ynones and propargylic substrates undergo divergent isomerizations to generate two types of allene species, i.e., ynone-allene II-1 via propargyl-allenyl isomerization (involving 1,3-hydrogen transfer) and enone-allene III via propargylic Alder ene-type61-63 (involving 1,8-hydrogen transfer), depending on heteroatoms at the propargyl carbon (Scheme 1b). The two different types of allenic intermediates then fulfill formal [2 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloadditions with high selectivity to provide polycyclic compounds of cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)-one and 11H-benzo[b]fluoren-11-one backbones, respectively (this finding, Scheme 1b). Here, we report the details on the development of these types of palladium-catalyzed tandem reactions involving divergent formation of allene intermediates with consecutive cyclizations, as well as a combined experimental and theoretical study to illustrate the reaction mechanism and the origin of the observed selectivity.",
        "Reaction Discovery and Optimization. We initially explored the reactions of 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-one (1a), with propargyl tosylamide 2a and propargyl benzyl ether 3a under the palladium catalysis in the presence of an excessive base, which was expected to facilitate the cross-coupling reaction and promote the propargyl-allenyl isomer-ization. The preliminary experiments showed that 1a coupled with 2a in the presence of 5 mol % Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, 10 mol % CuI and diisopropylamine (DIPA) to form the alkynylation intermediate, which was finally converted to a cyclobuta[b]-naphthalen-3(1H)-one product 4a in 40% yield as the product (Table 1, entry 1). In contrast, the reaction of 1a and 3a under similar reaction conditions gave rise to a skeletally different product, i.e., 5-benzoyl-11H-benzo[b]fluoren-11-one (5a) in 50% yield (Table 1, entry 15). Encouraged by these intriguing results, we next performed a series of optimization experiments by varying reaction parameters including the palladium catalyst, base, solvent, reaction temperature, and molar ratios of the substrates to improve the product yields (for detailed results, see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). It was found that the combination of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI with an excess DIPA as the base in toluene was the best system for both reactions. The optimal conditions were obtained as follows: the reaction of 1a and 2a (2/1 molar ratio) with 5 mol % Pd(PPh3)4 and 10 mol % CuI in toluene/ DIPA at 60 °C for 6 h gave 4a in 71% yield (Table 1, entry 11); and the reaction of 1a and 3a (1/1.2 molar ratio) with 5 mol % Pd(PPh3)4 and 10 mol % CuI in toluene/DIPA at 60 °C for 3 h produced 5a in 73% yield (Table 1, entry 26).",
        "Reaction Scope. With the optimal conditions in hand, the scopes of the two reactions were investigated (Table 2). Thus, 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ones bearing R1 sub-stituents as MeO, Cl, Br, and CF3 were all competent substrates to yield the corresponding products (4a-4i). The incorporation of an electron-withdrawing group R1 (CF3) leads to a decreased product yield as indicated from the results of 4e. In contrast, electronic nature of the R2 group has little impact on the reaction, and the products 4f-4i were all obtained in moderate to good yields (55-68%). Regarding propargyl tosylamides 2, R3 substituents including p-Me, p-MeO, p-Cl, and p-Br were tolerated to furnish products 4j-4m in moderate to good yields. The reaction of a naphthanenyl-derived substrate was also applicable, albeit producing 4n in a low yield. In addition, the performance of propargyl benzenesulfonamide and propargyl o-nitrobenzenesulfonamide were checked, and the reactions gave the products 4o and 4p in 75% and 45% yields, respectively. Noted that the reaction of 1-(2-iodocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-one failedto generate the expected product 4q. The structure of 4a was further characterized by an X-ray diffraction study.",
        "The reactions of various 1-(2-iodophenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-ones 1 with propargylic benzyl ethers 2 were also evaluated (Table 2, right column). 1-(2-Iodophenyl)-3-phenyl-prop-2-yn-1-ones 1 bearing R1 substituents as Me, MeO, Cl, and even the Br atom all reacted smoothly with 3a, to afford the corresponding products 5a-5e in 38-73% yields. Varied R2 substituents like Et, Cl, MeO, CN, and CF3 were allowed to give the expected products 5f-5j, 5r in 57-78% yields. Several variants on R3 like p-Cl, p-MeO, and o-MeO groups in propargyl benzyl ethers 3 were examined, and the reactions gave the expected products (5k-5m, 5o-5t) in good to high yields. It is notable that the incorporation of the electron-donating p-MeO group as R3 gave the products high yields (5l and 5t). However, the reaction of a 2-thiophenyl substrate with 1a gave the product 5n in a low yield (37%). Similarly, 1-(2-iodocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-one was not a suitable substrate to give the desired product 5u. The structure of 5h was further determined by an X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis unambiguously.",
        "Mechanism Study. The distinguished chemoselectivity of the above reactions clearly suggests remarkably different reactivities between the oxygen-and nitrogen-substituted alkyne-ynone intermediates engaged in the reactions. Thus, a series of control experiments were conducted to probe the reaction mechanism. As shown in Scheme 2, the Pd/Cu-catalyzed reaction of 1a and 2a performed at room temperature for 1.5 h afforded the cross-coupling product 6a in 90% yield. Treatment of 6a with DIPA in toluene for 6 h afforded 4a in 76-82% yield, while the reaction in the absence of DIPA did not give 4a (Scheme 2, eqs 1-3). In addition, it was observed that the presence of radical scavengers, i.e., 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, butylated hydroxytoluene, and 1,1-diphenylethene, led to a significant loss of product yield of 4a (Scheme 2, eq 4).",
        "On the other hand, the cross-coupling intermediate 6b from 1a and 3a was also isolated. Heating of 6b with toluene affords 5a in 75% yield (Scheme 2, eq 4). We also checked the reactions in the presence of the stronger base, i.e., DBU. It was found that a catalytic amount of DBU promoted the transformation of 6b into the cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)-one 5a″ in 35% yield (Scheme 2, eq 6).64 These results imply that the acidity of propargylic C-H in the alkyne-ynone intermediate (6a/6b) may play a critical role in the selectivity of the reaction. Moreover, it was found that the presence of radical scavengers did not shut down the transformation, suggesting that a free radical pathway is unlikely for the reaction (Scheme 2, eq 7). In addition, the detection of PhCH2OH by GC/MS analysis of the reaction mixture indicated the involvement of a hydrolysis step for the formation of the final product 5a.",
        "The labeling studies using deuterated substrates were performed to further gain insights into the mechanism (Scheme 3). The reaction of 1a and 2a-d gave 4a-d1 in 68% yield, in which only ca. 53% content of D was observed at C(8) (Scheme 3, eq 1). The significant loss of D content supports the notion that H/D exchange takes place in the DIPA-assisted propargyl-allenyl isomerization step (Scheme 5, vide infra). Conducting the reaction using the aprotonic Et3N as the base afforded 4a-d2 in which 84% D was incorporated, further supporting this assumption (Scheme 3, eq 2). On the other hand, the reaction of 1a and 3a-d under the optimal conditions produced 5a-d in 65% yield. 1H NMR analysis of this product showed that about 78% content of the D atom was incorporated into the C(10) position, almost consistent with the D content of 3a-d at the propargylic carbon (Scheme 3, eq 3). This result led us to postulate that a direct 1,8-H transfer of the cross-coupling intermediate 6b might take place during the reaction to form a different allenic intermediate (like species 15-Z in Scheme 5, vide infra) to fulfill the sequence.",
        "To verify the above hypothesis, we performed the reactions of 1a with allyl-substituted propargyl ethers 7a and 7b to capture the possible intermediates. Gratifyingly, both reactions proceeded smoothly under the optimal conditions and gaverise to the fused pentacyclic and tetracyclic products 8a and 8b with excellent diastereoselectivity in 54 and 80% yield, respectively (Scheme 4). The structure of 8a was unambigu-ously confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study. The product 8b was fully characterized by NMR spectra including COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC. It was interestingly observed that H(Ph) atoms of the indanone moiety in compound 8b show NMR signals at a relatively high field probably because of the shielding effect of the remote phenyl ring incorporated at the 2,3-dihydrofuran moiety. The formation of these productsthus can be rationalized by a process of intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction of the enone-allene intermediate 10/12, generated from a propargylic Alder-ene-type reaction of 9/11.",
        "At this stage, the plausible mechanism of the reaction was proposed (Scheme 5). The Pd/Cu-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction first generates the coupling intermediate. In the case of propargyl tosylamide 2a as the coupling partner, the cross-coupling intermediate 6a undergoes DIPA-assisted propargyl-allenyl isomerization to form an ynone-allene intermediate 14. The isomerization should proceed through an ion-pair intermediacy 13, as indicated by the deuterium-labeled experiments (Scheme 5, eqs 1 and 2). Subsequent intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 14 furnishes the product 4a. When propargyl benzyl ether 3a was employed as the coupling partner, the resulted intermediate 6b may undergo a propargylic Alder-ene-type reaction to give a cyclized enone-allene intermediate 15-Z. This step may be influenced by the sterically hindering effect of a substitute ortho to the carbonyl group in substrate 1, which is indicated by a low yield of 5e (Table 2). Subsequent 6π-electrocyclization forms a fused tetracyclic intermediate 16. Successive hydrolysis of the vinyl ether motif and aromatization finally form 5a.",
        "To validate the mechanism of the cycloaddition step to reveal the substituent-controlled chemoselectivity, we con-ducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the M06/6-311 + G(d,p)-SDD/SMD(toluene)//M06/6-31G(d)-SDD/SMD(toluene) level of theory. As shown in Figure 1, 1,6-diynes 6a and 6b, in situ generated from Sonogashira coupling, were chosen as the starting species in our theoretical study. In this type of diyne, the acidity of the propargylic hydrogen plays an important role in chemoselectivity. Either base-assisted 1,3-hydrogen transfer or Alder-ene-type hydrogen transfer could occur to achieve different transformations, which would depend on the neighboring substituent group. As shown in Figure 1a, 6a was chosen as relative zero in calculated free energy profiles. The [2 + 2] cycloaddition could start from a DIPA-assisted intramolecular 1,3-hydrogen transfer. The DIPA-promoted deprotonation of 6a at the propargyl position could occur to generate an allenyl anion species 13 via transition state TS-1. The calculated activation free energy is 25.4 kcal/mol for this process, which would be the rate-determining step. Subsequent re-protonation of the allenyl carbon in 13 could achieve 1,3-hydrogen transfer to generate the ynone-allene intermediate 14. The following [2 + 2] cycloaddition could take place through a stepwise pathway.65 The formation of the first C-C bond could occur to generate the diradical intermediate 17 via a close-shell transition state TS-3 with a free energy barrier of 20.7 kcal/mol. The radical-radical coupling takes place via an open-shell singlet transition state TS-4 to yield the product 4a in a highly exergonic step. The competitive intramolecular Alder-ene-type pathway was also considered. As shown in Figure 1a (left part), the Alder-ene-type hydrogen transfer would occur via transition state TS-5 with a free energy barrier of 26.7 kcal/mol to provide the enone-allene intermediate 18-Z for further transformations. The calculated activation free energy of this step is 1.3 kcal/ mol higher than that of DIPA-assisted 1,3-hydrogen transfer. Therefore, a stepwise process of 1,3-hydrogen transfer followed by [2 + 2] cycloaddition is preferred. On the other hand, DFT calculation revealed that the deprotonation of 1,6-diyne 6b needs to traverse a free energy barrier of 28.4 kcal/mol via proton transfer transition state TS-11 (Figure 1b). The free energy barrier of this step is 3.0 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding step using propargyl sulfonamido substituted 1,6-diyne 6a. It means the deprotonation of 6b is difficult compared with 6a. Based on this observation, we considered the alternative intramolecular Alder-ene-type reaction of 6b. DFT calculation clearly revealed that the free energy barrier of Alder-ene-type reaction via transition state TS-6 is 25.8 kcal/ mol, which is 2.6 kcal/mol lower than that of deprotonation via transition state TS-11. Therefore, Alder-ene-type reaction would take precedence over deprotonation, which leads to different chemoselectivity. The Alder-ene reaction gives an enone-allene intermediate 15-Z with exergonic energy of 38.9 kcal/mol leading to an irreversible process. Subsequently, the copper-promoted cis-trans isomerization occurs, eventually resulting in the generation of 15-E. This isomerization process is endothermic by 1.3 kcal mol-1, with an overall activation free energy of 19.2 kcal mol-1. The subsequent pericyclic 6π-electrocyclic reaction takes place via transition state TS-8, which reversibly provides a dearomatized benzofluorenone intermediate 16. Then, hydrolysis of vinyl ether moiety results in a ketone intermediate 19, which could undergo a dehydrogenation to achieve aromatization and yield the product 5a (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). DFT calculation clearly revealed that the chemoselectivity is determined by the acidity of propargyl hydrogen in the 1,6-diyne molecule. We calculated the acidity of intermediate 6a and 6b using B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)/IEFPCM(DMSO)// B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.66-70 We found that the pKa of 6a is 9.8, which is 0.9 lower than that of 6b, which could be attributed to the substituent effect. Therefore, 5a would be the major product when 6b is used as the reactant. Our DFT calculations are in complete agreement with experimental observation.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we have reported two sets of palladium-catalyzed tandem reactions involving cross-coupling, allene formation, and formal [2 + 2] or [4 + 2] cycloaddition, thereby providing a rapid synthesis of polycyclic compounds bearing cyclobuta[b]naphthalen-3(1H)-one and 5-benzoyl-11H-benzo[b]fluoren-11-one skeletons. The method has advantages such as the use of readily available starting materials, operational simplicity, catalytic conditions, and high selectivity. Mechanism studies indicated that the reactions involved the generation of two different types of allenic intermediates, i.e., ynone-allenes via propargyl-allenyl isomerization (1,3-hydro-gen transfer) and enone-allenes via the propargylic ene-type reaction (1,8-hydrogen transfer), from the corresponding cross-coupling intermediates. Detailed computational calcu-lations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and provide insights on the origin of the selectivity of the reactions. Ongoing efforts are currently directed to further expanding the scope and applications of the methodology.",
