Kinetic Studies and Modeling of a Self-Replicating System1-James S. Nowick, Qing Feng, Tjama Tjivikua, Pablo Ballester, and Julius Rebek, Jr.* Contribution from the Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139. Received April 29, 1991 Abstract: The design, synthesis, and study of a molecular template, 1 la, that catalyzes its own formation from simpler components, 9 and lOd, is described. Autocatalysis is shown by the following: (1) the increase in rate of reaction of 9 and lOd in the presence of 11a; (2) the reduction in rate of reaction in the presence of 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine inhibitor; and (3) the reduction in rate of reaction when a component incapable of template behavior, lOh, is substituted for lOd. Three kinetic pathways are elucidated: (1) the background bimolecular reaction (eq 6); (2) the preassociative mechanism (eq 7); and (3) the template termolecular process (eq 8). A kinetic model for the replication process is introduced, and equilibrium and rate constants are determined. Predictions for the shapes of the product growth curves are made. Introduction Replicating molecules stand on the boundary of chemistry and biology. Replication itself bears no structural content, yet the process invariably involves molecules that are complementary. This feature is apparent in the structure of double-stranded nucleic acids, and perhaps it is too obvious or self-evident to have war-ranted much discussion in the past. Whereas complementarity implies the presence of “positive” and “negative” molecules (e.g., strands of nucleic acids), self-complementarity transcends the need for a “negative” and thus provides a minimal system for replication. We have used the principle of self-complementarity as our polar star in this badly trampled terrain; it gives our structures design, shape, and ultimately, function.1 Scheme I provides a two-dimensional example of self-com-plementarity and geometrically illustrates the minimal require-ments of a self-replicating system. The sigmoid line represents the intermolecular contact between the two complementary and identical components. These units can be further broken along the jagged line into two different, yet complementary, pieces. The fusion of these pieces leads to a shape that can act as a template for the assembly of an identical unit. (A three-dimensional case has been described elsewhere.2) In this paper, we apply this concept in the context of chemical structures. A brief time ago, we introduced a synthetic system capable of self-replication.3 Unlike nucleic acids, replication occurs without the aid of enzymes or ribozymes.4 In contrast with natural systems and other synthetic self-replicating molecules,5 the new system involves the formation of an amide bond rather than a phosphate bond in the assembly step. Nevertheless, base-pairing provides the recognition and organization of the reacting com-ponents. Here, we report the experimental details of the reactions r Dedicated to Professor George Büchi on the occasion of his 70th birthday. Scheme I and describe the pecularities of its autocatalytic behavior. In a sequel, we shall address issues concerned with information, growth, and chemical evolution. Catalysis. One goal of molecular recognition is the merger of the binding and catalytic steps, to make these events converge in space and in time. For the most part, this aim is a restatement of the Pauling principle.6 It involves the maximum binding to, or recognition of, transition states. The recognition of transition states (rather than, say, their nearby high-energy intermediates) in small model systems is the challenge. Recent progress on this (1) Rebek, J., Jr. Angew. Chem., Int.

The specific intent was to convert an otherwise bimolecular reaction to a unimolecular (intramolecular) one. By understanding how the two components fit together, we could design an arrangement of reacting groups that would lead to a relatively effortless formation of a reactive intermediate within the complex. The basic binding event in our adenine receptors involves both hydrogen-bonding and aryl-stacking interactions in organic media. The triaxial arrangement of the carboxyl groups of Kemp’s triacid l* 11 provides a U-turn shape and permits the construction of molecules which “fold” back upon themselves. The imide 2a, which is prepared by condensation of Kemp’s triacid with am-monia, presents a hydrogen-bonding edge similar to that of thy-mine.12 Aromatic esters and amides of the remaining carboxyl extend beyond the hydrogen-bonding edge, presenting large, po-larizable surfaces to guests involved in base-pairing to the edge. Hydrogen-bonding and aromatic-stacking forces converge from perpendicular directions to provide a microenvironment com-plementary to adenine derivatives (eq 1). (1) Mere base-pairing is insufficient to drive two components to-gether in water, so we have used the magnification of hydro-gen-bonding forces available in CHC13 to insure high levels of intermolecular association. In doing so, we also contract the time scale of our experiments to manageable lengths. We attribute the difficulties encountered by previous workers in the field to their use of aqueous media. The effects are so small that only very long times could reveal self-replicating effects at, say, the mononucleotide level. The intimate contacts featured by these complexes were mapped out by NMR NOE techniques. These provided a level of pre-dictability in the placement of functional groups on the periphery of the components.12 A roughly 4-fold degeneracy exists in the overall complexation; Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen and reverse Watson-Crick and reverse Hoogsteen base-pairing all contribute to the association. Since some bifurcated hydrogen bonding was detected in the amide derivatives (e.g., 3),13 the complexes 4 were regarded as the major contributors. (These represent a complete description when the aromatic group is a phenyl derivative because rotation about the aryl-nitrogen bond does not alter the structure.) With different aromatic surfaces (e.g., the 2-naphthyl), the possibilities of binding are further compounded by the rotational isomerism about the N-aryl bond; this can lead to an actuarial nightmare. For the phenyl derivative, however, groups attached to the 9-position of adenine and the para position of the phenyl (7) Rebek, J., Jr. Acc. Chem. Res. 1984, 17, 258-264.

This propinquity eventually led to chemical reactions between the functional groups placed there. Development of a Self-Replicating System. In designing a molecule that acted as a template for its own formation, we set out to prepare two components bearing both complementary re-active-functionality and complementary hydrogen-bonding sur-faces. Our first attempts employed the Kemp’s triacid imide equipped with a phenyl spacer bearing a para acylating function as an electrophile (5a) and 9-(3-aminopropyl)adenine as a nu-cleophile.14 The latter was readily available from the alkylation of adenine. Its coupling with the p-nitrophenyl ester went smoothly. Competitive inhibition experiments indicated that coupling proceeded by way of the base-paired complex. Addition of other adenine derivatives or 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine to the reaction solution resulted in much-diminished coupling rates. Likewise, the TV-methyl imide 5b showed slower coupling. These diminutions are hard to rationalize as steric effects at a site so remote from the reaction center. Our early excitement quickly SiRiH 5b R * CHj (2) faded when the structure of the product was examined by NMR. Spectra of 8 obtained at various dilutions showed no downfield shift of the imide resonance, an indication of intramolecular base-pairing. Moreover, addition of other adenine derivatives did not affect this resonance, and all attempts to pry it open failed to affect the imide N-H resonance at about 12.4 ppm in CDC13. Further, NOE experiments indicated that the molecule remained folded shut in a Hoogsteen sense; irradiation of the imide NH enhanced H8 of the adenine but did not enhance H2. The molecule remained closed in the smug, self-satisfied sense of a rusted jackknife, impervious to external lubricants. It is too painful to recount in detail the experiments with the second generation system. Suffice to say, it also raised the gloomy prospects of early extinction. The problem was that the product molecules remained stuck together in a bimolecular fashion as the dimer (eq 3). However, these problems suggested that building a “bulge\" in the middle of the structure could help pry the dimer apart and then lead to the desired templation. Accordingly, we explored the possibility of using a ribosyl derivative as the adenine component. We had already observed the diminution of affinity of the ribosyl (vs ethyl) derivatives of adenine toward these ¡mides.12 (14) Leonard, N. J.; Lambert, R. F. J. Org. Chem. 1969, 34, 3240-3248. Kinetic Studies of a Self-Replicating System J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. ¡13. No. 23, 1991 8833 The fully blocked sugar provided some steric bulk adjacent to the aromatic-stacking surface. It seemed likely, therefore, that two such spherical lumps, near one another and with no particular affinity for each other, would destabilize the dimer. Accordingly, the 5'-aminoadenosine derivative 9 was prepared by standard procedures,15 and its coupling reactions to imides bearing 2,6-naphthalene surfaces (10) were examined (eq 4). The reaction 11a R » H 11b R » CH, with the acid chloride was too fast to follow conveniently, whereas that of the nitrophenyl ester was too slow. The amide adduct 11a was formed, and its self-affinity was suitable. Dilution studies gave a value for Kdim of 630 M'1 for the product; the bulge was doing its job. Moreover, preliminary experiments with additives such as 9-ethyladenine slowed the coupling rate, but adding the reaction product speeded it up\\ The active ester selected for the detailed studies was the pentafluorophenyl derivative. The preparation of compounds used in these studies was straightforward. The syntheses of the imide derivatives lOa-d and the A-methyl analogues lOe-h are outlined in eq 5. Kemp’s triacid 1 was converted to the imide acid chloride 2b as previously described.12 Coupling of 2b to the naphthol 12c generated ester 10a. Deprotection (H30+, acetone), conversion to the acid chloride (S0C12), and reaction with pentafluorophenol and triethylamine gave the pentafluorophenyl ester lOd. The A-methyl derivatives lOe-h were prepared in a similar fashion. \\o CO,CM,OCH, (12c) 2a R  ,X µ OH 2b R  M,X . a 2C R a CM,, X a OH 2d R a CH,.

The association constants of the various components toward one another were determined by means of NMR titrations.12 The experimental data for associations are shown in Scheme II. From these data, a value of Ka =B 60 M'1 for the association of imides lOd or 11a with adenosyl derivatives appears most relevant to the discussion that Scheme II follows. In conjunction with the dimerization constant Kdim of template 11a, this value can quantitate the effect that the bulge in the middle of the molecule has on its dimerization. If the two ends show identical affinity, then the Kdim expected would be at least (Ka)2. It should actually be more because loss of translational entropy would not be required twice, as is the case in the chelate effect.16 Bulges exist in both the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen senses, and NOE experiments showed no particular bias in the arrangement of the dimer. Modeling suggests that the stacking is better when base-pairing occurs in the Watson-Crick form. We assume that the modest value of Kdim (630 M'1) reflects that the ribose acetonides in the middle of the dimer interact sterically. Kinetics Studies. Having established that template 11a catalyzes the coupling of amine 9 and ester lOd, we set out to quantitatively determine the rate of reaction. Continuous assay by NMR was desirable, but concentration-dependent shifts, broad NH reso-nances, and overlapping multiplets did not permit the accuracy (by integration) necessary to determine the relative concentration of each component. Instead, HPLC was used as the analytical method. In typical kinetic experiments, a solution of the reactants and template in CHC13 was analyzed periodically. Triethylamine was added to complex the liberated phenol and to help prevent its protonation of the aminoadenosine during the course of the reaction. All of the coupling reactions were performed with an excess of this material present (generally 4 equiv). Identical rates were observed in the presence of 4 and 8 equiv of triethylamine. Reactions of amine 9 and pentafluorophenyl ester lOd were studied at 1.65, 8.2, and 16.5 mM concentrations. In experiments in which template 11a was added, 0.2 or 0.5 equiv was employed. The template and amine proved to be the best species to monitor. Competing processes, such as hydrolysis of the pentafluorophenyl ester moiety by adventitious water (especially under dilute con-ditions or in longer runs), limit somewhat the accuracy of the data. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of the kinetic behavior and the coupling rates was very good. Preliminary studies were performed at 8.2 mM concentration of reactants 9 and lOd (Figure 1). The effect of added template and inhibitor upon the rates of reaction was examined. The initial rates of reaction were calculated by linear least-squares analysis of data collected during the first 60 min of the reaction. An initial rate of 1.00 X 10'5 M min'1 was observed for the reaction of 9 and lOd (Figure la). In the presence of added template 11a, a significant rate increase occurs. When 0.20 equiv of 11a is added, the initial rate increases by 43% (1.43 X 10'5 M min'1, Figure lb); when 0.50 equiv is added, the rate increases by 73% (1.73 X 10\"5 M min\"1, Figure lc). 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine inhibits the reaction; addition of 1 equiv reduces the rate to 0.49 X 10\"5 (15) Kolb, M.; Danzin, C.; Barth, J.; Clavarle, N.

Table I summarizes the rate data described in this section. Discussion Three reactions contribute to the formation of product: the background bimolecular reaction, the base-paired bimolecular reaction, and the termolecular template-catalyzed process. The latter reaction is responsible for the replication process. Their interplay determines the shape of the kinetic curves. Background Bimolecular Reaction. The aminoadenosine 9 reacts with the pentafluorophenyl ester lOd by means of a bi-molecular reaction, as shown in eq 6. The background bimolecular reaction was established with the A-methyl imide derivative of the pentafluorophenyl ester lOh as the acylating agent. The rate H T. 11a (6) constant for this process is 0.023 M\"' min'1. An independent measure of the background bimolecular rate, using 2,6-bis(ace-tylamino)pyridine as an inhibitor (Afa = 450 M\"1) in the reaction of 9 with the parent (NH) derivative lOd, gave a value consistent with that obtained from the A-methyl compound lOh (vide infra). Base-Pairing or Preassociative Mechanism. A second pathway, in which amine 9 and ester lOd form a hydrogen-bonded dimer AE prior to reaction, has a far greater role in the generation of template 11a (eq 7). In this complex, the amino and penta-fluorophenyl groups are in close proximity and readily react to generate the template in its cis amide conformation, cis-T. Isomerization to the more stable trans amide occurs rapidly. H T-11a (7) That the NH derivative lOd reacts 6.5-fold more rapidly with the aminoadenosine 9 than the A-methyl derivative lOh under the same conditions provides strong evidence for this preassociative mechanism (Table I). The inhibition of the reaction of 9 and lOd by 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine provides additional evidence. A decrease in the rate of reaction corresponding to the decrease in the fraction of base-paired complex is observed. From the base-pairing association constant between 9 and lOd (ca. 60 M'1; vide supra), it can be calculated that the initial mixture at 8.2 X 10\"3 M concentration involves 27% base-paired and 73% free components. The former contribute to the preassociative mech-anism, whereas the latter contribute to the background reaction. When 1 equiv of 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine (ATa = 450 M\"1 with lOd) is added to this mixture, the fraction of free ester lOd de-creases to 32%. While the ester that is complexed with 2,6-bis-(acetylamino)pyridine (54%) should still be reactive toward amine 9 via the background bimolecular pathway, it is unable to par-ticipate in the preassociative mechanism. The fraction of base pair is calculated to be 14% (51% of the value in the absence of the inhibitor), while the observed rate is 48% of the value in the absence of inhibitor (Table I). Termolecular Template Process. The template-catalyzed, replicative process (eq 8) was revealed by the enhanced rate of reaction of amine 9 and ester lOd upon addition of the template product 11a to coupling mixtures. In this mechanism, the amine, ester, and template first form a termolecular complex, AET. The close proximity of the reactive amino and pentafluorophenyl ester groups then leads to amide formation. The resulting template dimer T2 exists in equilibrium with the free template.17 Control experiments with the A-methyl imide product lib showed that its presence did not increase (or significantly decrease) the rate of product formation. Kinetic Modeling of the Replication Process. The self-repli-cating system contains a variety of species in rapid equilibrium. For the purposes of this discussion, we have assigned easily identified letter names (shown in eqs 6-8) to these species. At millimolar concentrations, there are substantial amounts of the bimolecular species AE, AT, ET, and T2 and some termolecular complex AET in addition to the free amine A (9), ester E (lOd), and template T (11a). Equations 9-14 represent all significant complexation processes. The values of the various equilibrium constants were determined by extrapolation from the related systems shown in Scheme II, from which Kh K2, and K3 were each estimated to be 60 M™1. The absence of steric or electronic communication between the two ends of the template suggests that K4 and K5 should have the similar values.

The three pathways by which template is generated were de-scribed above. (1) In the background bimolecular pathway, the amine A and ester E react without preassociation to give the template T, with a rate constant of kx (eq 15). Hydrogen-bonded species (i.e., AE, AT, ET, and AET) can also react with each other by means of this bimolecular pathway. (2) In the base-paired bimolecular pathway, the hydrogen-bonded complex AE reacts to generate the template, initially in an unstable cis amide con-formation with a rate constant of k2 (eq 16). Isomerization to the more stable trans conformation is assumed to be a rapid, thermodynamically favorable process. (3) In the autocatalytic, template termolecular pathway the template forms via the complex AET with a rate constant of k2 (eq 17). *| A + E — T(15) k, AE —T (16) k\\ AET — T2(17) Kinetic modeling of the overall process was performed with use of an iterative numerical method.18 Fitting of the observed data from experiments performed at 8.2 X 10'3 M in amine 9 and ester lOd or lOh generates values of 0.023 M\"1 min-1, 0.0036 min\"1, and 0.070 min\"1 for ku k2, and k2, respectively. Rate constants were determined by minimizing the least-squares difference be-tween observed and calculated values and also by matching of the calculated and experimental initial rates of reaction. Figure 6 shows the calculated vs experimental formation of template as a function of time. A satisfactory fit was obtained within the limits of the precision of the data.19 (The discrepancy between curve d and the corresponding data points arises from the presence of a small quantity of N-methylated template lib at the beginning of the experiment.) A number of systematic errors limit the accuracy of these rate constants. Notable are variations in temperature, evaporative losses of solvent during prolonged runs, and slow hydrolysis of the ester by adventitious H20. The rate constants were found to fit other reaction conditions only moderately well. The initially observed rate of reaction of 9 and lOd at 1.65 mM was calculated to be 18 times slower than that at 8.2 mM, whereas a 20-fold slower rate was actually observed (Table I). The initially observed (18) The course of the reaction was treated as 100 time increments, At. Equilibrium concentrations of A, E, T, AE, AT, ET, T2, and AET were calculated at each time increment by using successive approximations. The incremental formation of template was calculated by the equation:  [ ]101= ,    ,  +MAE] /+ **3[   ] ,in which [ ] ,[E]t„, and [T]m represent the total concentrations of amine, ester, and template present. Calculations were performed on a Macintosh computer with Microsoft Excel. (19) An alternative model for the kinetics of self-replicating systems was introduced by von Kiedrowski in 1986. (See refs 5a-c.) In this model, the rate is given as the sum of an autocatalytic term and a background term. The magnitude of the autocatalytic term is proportional to the square root of the total concentration of template, i.e., rate = k,[A]lol[E]lot[T]tot1/2 + *b[A]l0|[E]101. While this model is primarily applicable to systems in which the template predominantly exists as the dimer, such as oligonuclotides, it fits the data presented in the results section quite well. We found the best fit rate constants to be k, = 4 X 10\"2 M\"3/2 s\"1 and kh = 2 X 10\"3 M\"1 s\"1. These values differ substantially from the values kt = 9.87 X 10\"2 M\"3/2 s'1 and kb = 1.24 X 10\"3 M\"1 s\"1, which von Kiedrowski reports for our system (ref 5c). The von Kiedrowski model provides a simple, elegant, and effective means of obtaining the kinetic parameters of autocatalytic systems without the need for equilibrium constants. The model presented in this paper accounts for the mechanistic details of the reaction and for the role of each of the three mechanistic pathways (background bimolecular, preassociative, and template termolecular). This model permits specific predictions about the effects of changes in structure and binding affinities upon the rates of reaction. Figure 6. Experimental (points) and calculated (lines) generation of template 11a or lib as a function of time. All reactions were performed with initial concentrations [9] = [lOd or lOh] = 0.0082 M in CHC13. (a) Reaction of 9 and lOd. (b) Reaction of 9 and lOd with 0.20 equiv of 11a added as autocatalyst, (c) Reaction of 9 and lOd with 0.50 equiv of 11a added as autocatalyst, (d) Reaction of 9 and the N-methylated 10b. rate of reaction of 9 and lOd at 16.5 mM was calculated to be 3.3 times as fast as that at 8.2 mM, while a 5.6-fold greater rate was observed (Table I). A portion of this discrepancy appears to arise from systematic errors, however. When the same stock solutions of 9 and lOd were used for both the 16 and the 8 mM runs, only a 4.2-fold greater rate was observed. In all cases, the kinetic model predicted the observed trends in reactivity quite well. That some quantitative variations from the model are observed may indicate the limitations of the model, as well as systematic experimental errors. The ratio of the rate constants of an intramolecular reaction and its intermolecular counterpart corresponds to the “effective molarity” of the reacting groups in the intramolecular reaction and thereby provides an index of the efficiency of the intramo-lecular process. Reaction by means of the hydrogen-bonded complexes (AE and AET in eqs 16 and 17) constitutes intra-molecular processes that can be compared to the bimolecular reaction (eq 15). It is interesting to note that the effective mo-larities of the amine and ester groups are actually higher in the termolecular complex AET than in the bimolecular complex AE (k¡/ki = 3.0 M, k2/k{ = 0.16 M). This 19-fold difference in effective molarity may reflect a higher activation energy for formation of the cis conformation of amide 11a from the bimo-lecular complex AE or a more favorable arrangement of functional groups in the termolecular complex AET. It is generally difficult to compare reactions of different orders because of differing trajectories and stereoelectronic effects.20 In spite of the greater effective molarity in the termolecular complex, a large fraction of the product forms by the preassociative bimolecular pathway because of the difference in molecularity of the two processes. Under typical reaction conditions (e.g., 10~2 M concentration of reactants), the concentration of the bimolecular complex far exceeds the concentration of the termolecular complex. Table II illustrates the concentrations of individual species (A, E, T, AE, AT, ET, AET, T2) present as a function of the total concentrations of species containing amine, ester and template ([AW [EW [TW [A]= [A] + [AE] + [AT] + [AET]; [ ] (20) For a discussion with leading references, see: Kemp, D.

All calculations were performed with the experimentally deter-mined rate and equilibrium constants (see text), (a) Top, initial con-centrations: [9] = [lOd] = 0.001 M. (b) Middle, initial concentrations: [9] = [lOd] = 0.01 M. (c) Bottom, initial concentrations: [9] = [lOd] = 0.1 M. = [E] + [AE] + [ET] + [AET]; [T]tol = [AT] + [ET] + [AET] + 2[T2]). For example, in the presence of 0.3 equiv of added template ([A]tot = [E]lol = 0.010 M, [T]tot = 0.003 M), 67% of the amine and ester are free, 27% are associated with each other, and 1.5% are present as the termolecular complex. Under these conditions, the relative rates of the background bimolecular pathway, the preassociative pathway, and the template termole-cular pathway are 1,0:4.3:4.6, respectively. While the background bimolecular reaction contributes only slightly to the formation of product, both the preassociative (uncatalyzed) and the template (autocatalytic) mechanisms contribute substantially. Of particular interest is the shape of the product growth curve. In a system in which most of the product forms by an autocatalytic pathway, a sigmoidal growth curve is expected.21 Even so, sig-moidal growth has been difficult to observe in a self-replicating system.3·5·23 Our model predicts that the initial concentration of reactants should substantially affect the shape of the growth curve. At concentrations on the order of 10\"3 M, the contribution of the autocatalytic pathway is insignificant in our system, and the reaction profile is similar to that of the simple bimolecular kinetics (Figure 7a). A slight sigmoidal shape should be observed at initial concentrations in the order of 10\"2 M (Figure 7b). Unfortunately, the degree of sigmoidal curvature is small in comparison to the uncertainty in the data points and is not ob-servable. At concentrations on the order of 10\"1 M, a significantly sigmoidal growth curve is anticipated (Figure 7c). Limitations (21) The occurrence of sigmoidal growth can be established graphically by examining plots of the first or second derivative of [product] vs time (r). The magnitude of the sigmoidal growth can be quantified as the ratio of the maximal value of d[T]/dr (or [ ]/ )to the initial value of d[T]/df (or [ ]/ ().(22) For a self-replicating system of reverse micelles, see: Bachmann, P. A.; Walde, P.; Luisi, P. L; Lang, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990,112, 8200-8201. (23) For a recently published exception, see ref 5c. Figure 8. Calculated effect of rate constants k¡, k2, and k¡ upon the growth curve. All calculations were performed for initial concentrations [9] = [lOd] =0.01 M with the experimentally determined equilibrium constants (see text), (a) k{ = 0.023 M\"1 min'1, k2 = 0.0036 min\"1, k} = 0.070 min\"1, (b) k¡ = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0, k} = 0.070 min\"1, (c) k¡ = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0.0036 min\"1, k¡ = 0. (d) k¡ = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0, k} = 0. of solubility prevented our studying the reaction at concentrations in which substantial sigmoidal behavior is expected. We have also used this model to predict the effects of changes in the rate constants upon the shape of the growth curve (Figure 8). Curve a represents the reaction profile calculated for typical reaction conditions (0.010 M initial concentration of 9 and lOd) with the experimentally determined rate constants (k¡ = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0.0036 min\"1, and k} = 0.070 min\"1). A slight inflection is calculated in this curve, but it is too small to be observed experimentally (vide supra). If the preassociative bi-molecular pathway were not operative (i.e., fc, = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0, and k} = 0.070 min'1), then a highly sigmoidal growth curve b would be observed. For comparison, curve c represents the growth curve in the absence of an autocatalytic mechanism (i.e., kt = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0.0036 min\"1, and k} = 0), and curve d corresponds to reaction by a simple bimolecular mechanism (i.e., k¡ = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0, and k} = 0). Needless to say, both c and d lack inflection points. Structurally modified mol-ecules in which the electrophile and nucleophile are at a sufficient distance in the base-paired, bimolecular complex such that the preassociative bimolecular pathway is not possible (i.e., k2 = 0) are now in hand. We will report upon these studies in due course. Conclusion and Outlook In this paper we have provided a detailed description of the design, synthesis, and study of a molecular template, 11a, that catalyzes its own formation from simpler components, 9 and lOd. Together, the components and template make up a self-replicating system. Three reaction pathways lead to the formation of template, yet only one, the template termolecular process, is re-sponsible for replication. A kinetic model for the replication process has been developed. Modeling studies indicate that both the preassociative mechanism and the template termolecular process contribute substantially to the formation of template. Calculations predict that a system in which the preassociative mechanism cannot operate will self-replicate efficiently and will exhibit a highly sigmoidal growth curve. The fundamental feature of our self-replicating system is self-complementarity. It may now be easier to visualize other possibilities.22 The fixation on double-stranded nucleic acids is natural, and their catalytic features suggest their originality. What other structures can be considered? We mention two beyond the current system. The first involves hybrid structures of amino acids with nucleic acids. For the second, we have identified naturally occurring peptides that show the requisite structural features. 8838 J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 113, No. 23, 1991 Nowick et al. Whether these live up to their promise in catalyzing their own replication is the subject of our current efforts. Experimental Section General.

Kinetics Studies. The reaction of imide esters lOd and lOh with amine 9 in the presence and absence of templates 11a and lib was performed in CHCI3 solution containing ca. 4 equiv of Et3N. A Waters 600 HPLC equipped with a UV detector (254 nm) was used for the analysis of reaction mixtures. Analyses were performed with a mixture of water-methanol-Et3N (30:70:0.1) as the mobile phase and a reverse-phase column (Beckman C18 column, Ultrasphere ODS dp, 5 µ ,4.6 mm i.d. X 25 cm, flow rate = 1.5 mL/min). The integrations and concentrations of all the peaks were calculated on an NEC computer with Waters 820 Baseline software. In case of prolonged reactions (>100 min), a meth-anol flush was performed between injections to ensure complete elution of esters lOd and 10b. CHC13 was dried over molecular sieves or by passage through A1203 before use. All experiments were performed at ambient temperature (21.5-23.0 °C). Each run was performed 2-4 times to obtain average values for the data. Calibration of HPLC. The HPLC was calibrated by the injection of solutions of amine 9 and template 11a of varying concentration. A linear relationship between concentration and peak area was observed. Reac-tion mixtures were analyzed on the basis of either the area of the template peak or the ratio of the amine and template peaks. Reaction Procedures. During initial studies (data presented in Figures 1 and 5), reactions were performed in 100 µ ofsolvent in 1-mL. Wheaton serum vials equipped with aluminum caps and Teflon-coated silicone septa (procedure A). During subsequent studies (data presented in Figures 2-4), 1-mL Wheaton screw-cap vials equipped with Mininert valves were used to minimize evaporative losses of solvent, and 500 µ of solvent was used to reduce changes in concentration arising from solvent evaporation (procedure B). Typical Reaction Procedure A. Reaction of Imide Ester lOd and Amine 9. A 1-mL Wheaton serum vial equipped with a aluminum cap and a silicone rubber septum coated with Teflon was charged with 20 µ ofCHCI3, ca. 1 µ ofEt3N, 40 µ ofamine 9 stock solution (2.05 X 10~2 M), and 40 µ ofpentafluoro ester stock solution lOd (2.05 X 10\"2 M). The reaction mixture was shaken gently with a mechanical shaker. Aliquots (1.0 µ )were withdrawn periodically and analyzed by HPLC. Typical Reaction Procedure B. Reaction of Imide Ester lOd and Amine 9 in the Presence of Template 11a. A 1-mL Wheaton reaction vial equipped with a Mininert valve and a stir vane was charged with 260 µ of CHCI3 and 4.6 µ ofEt3N. Stock solutions of amine 9 (100 µ ,8.2 X 10™2 M), template 11a (40 µ ,4.1 X 10\"2 M), and pentafluoro ester lOd (100 µ ,8.2 X 10~2 M) were added by a microliter syringe. Aliquots (10 µ )were withdrawn from the reaction solution periodically, diluted with 90 µ ofCHCI3, and analyzed by HPLC (10 µ injected).Acknowledgment.

Received March 1, 1991. Revised Manuscript Received July 18, 1991 Abstract: The stereoselectivity of the intramolecular photocycloaddition of a series of bicyclic dioxenones has been examined. The selective formation of trans-fused photoadducts is observed in almost all cases, which upon fragmentation lead to the synthesis of bicycloalkanones with an “inside-outside” or trans intrabridgehead stereochemical relationship. This methodology has been applied to the synthesis of several “inside-outside” bicycloalkanones that cannot otherwise be prepared. The unusual reactivity of both the dioxanone photoadducts and the bicycloalkanone fragmentation products is described. Introduction The de Mayo reaction has served as an important example of the utility of enone photocycloaddition chemistry in organic synthesis for almost 30 years. Cycloaddition of the enol of a /3-diketone with an alkene leads to the formation of a cyclobutane, which on fragmentation gives a product containing a 1,5-di-carbonyl moiety.4·5 Since the pioneering studies of  zer6and Pattenden,7 the intramolecular version of this reaction has attracted considerable attention as a powerful method for the construction of structurally complex polycyclic ring systems be-f Dedicated to Professor Ronald C.

Received April 29, 1991Abstract: The design, synthesis, and study of a molecular template, 1 la, that catalyzes its own formation from simpler components, 9 and lOd, is described. Autocatalysis is shown by the following: (1) the increase in rate of reaction of 9 and lOd in the presence of 11a; (2) the reduction in rate of reaction in the presence of 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine inhibitor; and (3) the reduction in rate of reaction when a component incapable of template behavior, lOh, is substituted for lOd. Three kinetic pathways are elucidated: (1) the background bimolecular reaction (eq 6); (2) the preassociative mechanism (eq 7); and (3) the template termolecular process (eq 8). A kinetic model for the replication process is introduced, and equilibrium and rate constants are determined. Predictions for the shapes of the product growth curves are made.",
        "Replicating molecules stand on the boundary of chemistry and biology. Replication itself bears no structural content, yet the process invariably involves molecules that are complementary. This feature is apparent in the structure of double-stranded nucleic acids, and perhaps it is too obvious or self-evident to have war-ranted much discussion in the past. Whereas complementarity implies the presence of “positive” and “negative” molecules (e.g., strands of nucleic acids), self-complementarity transcends the need for a “negative” and thus provides a minimal system for replication. We have used the principle of self-complementarity as our polar star in this badly trampled terrain; it gives our structures design, shape, and ultimately, function.1Scheme I provides a two-dimensional example of self-com-plementarity and geometrically illustrates the minimal require-ments of a self-replicating system. The sigmoid line represents the intermolecular contact between the two complementary and identical components. These units can be further broken along the jagged line into two different, yet complementary, pieces. The fusion of these pieces leads to a shape that can act as a template for the assembly of an identical unit. (A three-dimensional case has been described elsewhere.2) In this paper, we apply this concept in the context of chemical structures.",
        "A brief time ago, we introduced a synthetic system capable of self-replication.3 Unlike nucleic acids, replication occurs without the aid of enzymes or ribozymes.4 In contrast with natural systems and other synthetic self-replicating molecules,5 the new system involves the formation of an amide bond rather than a phosphate bond in the assembly step. Nevertheless, base-pairing provides the recognition and organization of the reacting com-ponents. Here, we report the experimental details of the reactionsr Dedicated to Professor George Büchi on the occasion of his 70th birthday.",

One goal of molecular recognition is the merger of the binding and catalytic steps, to make these events converge in space and in time. For the most part, this aim is a restatement of the Pauling principle.6 It involves the maximum binding to, or recognition of, transition states.

        "The basic binding event in our adenine receptors involves both hydrogen-bonding and aryl-stacking interactions in organic media. The triaxial arrangement of the carboxyl groups of Kemp’s triacid l* 11 provides a U-turn shape and permits the construction of molecules which “fold” back upon themselves. The imide 2a, which is prepared by condensation of Kemp’s triacid with am-monia, presents a hydrogen-bonding edge similar to that of thy-mine.12 Aromatic esters and amides of the remaining carboxyl extend beyond the hydrogen-bonding edge, presenting large, po-larizable surfaces to guests involved in base-pairing to the edge. Hydrogen-bonding and aromatic-stacking forces converge from perpendicular directions to provide a microenvironment com-plementary to adenine derivatives (eq 1).",
        "Mere base-pairing is insufficient to drive two components to-gether in water, so we have used the magnification of hydro-gen-bonding forces available in CHC13 to insure high levels of intermolecular association. In doing so, we also contract the time scale of our experiments to manageable lengths. We attribute the difficulties encountered by previous workers in the field to their use of aqueous media. The effects are so small that only very long times could reveal self-replicating effects at, say, the mononucleotide level.",
        "The intimate contacts featured by these complexes were mapped out by NMR NOE techniques. These provided a level of pre-dictability in the placement of functional groups on the periphery of the components.12 A roughly 4-fold degeneracy exists in the overall complexation; Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen and reverse Watson-Crick and reverse Hoogsteen base-pairing all contribute to the association. Since some bifurcated hydrogen bonding was detected in the amide derivatives (e.g., 3),13 the complexes 4 were regarded as the major contributors. (These represent a complete description when the aromatic group is a phenyl derivative because rotation about the aryl-nitrogen bond does not alter the structure.) With different aromatic surfaces (e.g., the 2-naphthyl), the possibilities of binding are further compounded by the rotational isomerism about the N-aryl bond; this can lead to an actuarial nightmare.

In designing a molecule that acted as a template for its own formation, we set out to prepare two components bearing both complementary re-active-functionality and complementary hydrogen-bonding sur-faces. Our first attempts employed the Kemp’s triacid imide equipped with a phenyl spacer bearing a para acylating function as an electrophile (5a) and 9-(3-aminopropyl)adenine as a nu-cleophile.14 The latter was readily available from the alkylation of adenine. Its coupling with the p-nitrophenyl ester went smoothly. Competitive inhibition experiments indicated that coupling proceeded by way of the base-paired complex. Addition of other adenine derivatives or 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine to the reaction solution resulted in much-diminished coupling rates. Likewise, the TV-methyl imide 5b showed slower coupling. These diminutions are hard to rationalize as steric effects at a site so remote from the reaction center. Our early excitement quicklySiRiH 5b R * CHjfaded when the structure of the product was examined by NMR. Spectra of 8 obtained at various dilutions showed no downfield shift of the imide resonance, an indication of intramolecular base-pairing. Moreover, addition of other adenine derivatives did not affect this resonance, and all attempts to pry it open failed to affect the imide N-H resonance at about 12.4 ppm in CDC13. Further, NOE experiments indicated that the molecule remained folded shut in a Hoogsteen sense; irradiation of the imide NH enhanced H8 of the adenine but did not enhance H2. The molecule remained closed in the smug, self-satisfied sense of a rusted jackknife, impervious to external lubricants. It is too painful to recount in detail the experiments with the second generation system. Suffice to say, it also raised the gloomy prospects of early extinction. The problem was that the product molecules remained stuck together in a bimolecular fashion as the dimer (eq 3). However, these problems suggested that building a “bulge\" in the middle of the structure could help pry the dimer apart and then lead to the desired templation. Accordingly, we explored the possibility of using a ribosyl derivative as the adenine component.",

The association constants of the various components toward one another were determined by means of NMR titrations.12 The experimental data for associations are shown in Scheme II. From these data, a value of Ka =B 60 M'1 for the association of imides lOd or 11a with adenosyl derivatives appears most relevant to the discussion thatfollows. In conjunction with the dimerization constant Kdim of template 11a, this value can quantitate the effect that the bulge in the middle of the molecule has on its dimerization. If the two ends show identical affinity, then the Kdim expected would be at least (Ka)2. It should actually be more because loss of translational entropy would not be required twice, as is the case in the chelate effect.16 Bulges exist in both the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen senses, and NOE experiments showed no particular bias in the arrangement of the dimer. Modeling suggests that the stacking is better when base-pairing occurs in the Watson-Crick form. We assume that the modest value of Kdim (630 M'1) reflects that the ribose acetonides in the middle of the dimer interact sterically. Kinetics Studies. Having established that template 11a catalyzes the coupling of amine 9 and ester lOd, we set out to quantitatively determine the rate of reaction. Continuous assay by NMR was desirable, but concentration-dependent shifts, broad NH reso-nances, and overlapping multiplets did not permit the accuracy (by integration) necessary to determine the relative concentration of each component. Instead, HPLC was used as the analytical method. In typical kinetic experiments, a solution of the reactants and template in CHC13 was analyzed periodically. Triethylamine was added to complex the liberated phenol and to help prevent its protonation of the aminoadenosine during the course of the reaction. All of the coupling reactions were performed with an excess of this material present (generally 4 equiv). Identical rates were observed in the presence of 4 and 8 equiv of triethylamine. Reactions of amine 9 and pentafluorophenyl ester lOd were studied at 1.65, 8.2, and 16.5 mM concentrations. In experiments in which template 11a was added, 0.2 or 0.5 equiv was employed. The template and amine proved to be the best species to monitor. Competing processes, such as hydrolysis of the pentafluorophenyl ester moiety by adventitious water (especially under dilute con-ditions or in longer runs), limit somewhat the accuracy of the data. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of the kinetic behavior and the coupling rates was very good. Preliminary studies were performed at 8.2 mM concentration of reactants 9 and lOd (Figure 1). The effect of added template and inhibitor upon the rates of reaction was examined. The initial rates of reaction were calculated by linear least-squares analysis of data collected during the first 60 min of the reaction. An initial rate of 1.00 X 10'5 M min'1 was observed for the reaction of 9 and lOd (Figure la). In the presence of added template 11a, a significant rate increase occurs. When 0.20 equiv of 11a is added, the initial rate increases by 43% (1.43 X 10'5 M min'1, Figure lb); when 0.50 equiv is added, the rate increases by 73% (1.73 X 10\"5 M min\"1, Figure lc). 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine inhibits the reaction; addition of 1 equiv reduces the rate to 0.49 X 10\"5(15) Kolb, M.; Danzin, C.; Barth, J.; Clavarle, N.

        "Background Bimolecular Reaction. The aminoadenosine 9 reacts with the pentafluorophenyl ester lOd by means of a bi-molecular reaction, as shown in eq 6. The background bimolecular reaction was established with the A-methyl imide derivative of the pentafluorophenyl ester lOh as the acylating agent. The rateconstant for this process is 0.023 M\"' min'1. An independent measure of the background bimolecular rate, using 2,6-bis(ace-tylamino)pyridine as an inhibitor (Afa = 450 M\"1) in the reaction of 9 with the parent (NH) derivative lOd, gave a value consistent with that obtained from the A-methyl compound lOh (vide infra).",
        "Base-Pairing or Preassociative Mechanism. A second pathway, in which amine 9 and ester lOd form a hydrogen-bonded dimer AE prior to reaction, has a far greater role in the generation of template 11a (eq 7). In this complex, the amino and penta-fluorophenyl groups are in close proximity and readily react to generate the template in its cis amide conformation, cis-T. Isomerization to the more stable trans amide occurs rapidly.",
        "That the NH derivative lOd reacts 6.5-fold more rapidly with the aminoadenosine 9 than the A-methyl derivative lOh under the same conditions provides strong evidence for this preassociative mechanism (Table I). The inhibition of the reaction of 9 and lOd by 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine provides additional evidence. A decrease in the rate of reaction corresponding to the decrease in the fraction of base-paired complex is observed. From thebase-pairing association constant between 9 and lOd (ca. 60 M'1; vide supra), it can be calculated that the initial mixture at 8.2 X 10\"3 M concentration involves 27% base-paired and 73% free components. The former contribute to the preassociative mech-anism, whereas the latter contribute to the background reaction. When 1 equiv of 2,6-bis(acetylamino)pyridine (ATa = 450 M\"1 with lOd) is added to this mixture, the fraction of free ester lOd de-creases to 32%. While the ester that is complexed with 2,6-bis-(acetylamino)pyridine (54%) should still be reactive toward amine 9 via the background bimolecular pathway, it is unable to par-ticipate in the preassociative mechanism. The fraction of base pair is calculated to be 14% (51% of the value in the absence of the inhibitor), while the observed rate is 48% of the value in the absence of inhibitor (Table I). Termolecular Template Process. The template-catalyzed, replicative process (eq 8) was revealed by the enhanced rate of reaction of amine 9 and ester lOd upon addition of the template product 11a to coupling mixtures. In this mechanism, the amine,ester, and template first form a termolecular complex, AET. The close proximity of the reactive amino and pentafluorophenyl ester groups then leads to amide formation. The resulting template dimer T2 exists in equilibrium with the free template.17 Control experiments with the A-methyl imide product lib showed that its presence did not increase (or significantly decrease) the rate of product formation. Kinetic Modeling of the Replication Process. The self-repli-cating system contains a variety of species in rapid equilibrium. For the purposes of this discussion, we have assigned easily identified letter names (shown in eqs 6-8) to these species. At millimolar concentrations, there are substantial amounts of the bimolecular species AE, AT, ET, and T2 and some termolecular complex AET in addition to the free amine A (9), ester E (lOd), and template T (11a). Equations 9-14 represent all significant complexation processes. The values of the various equilibrium constants were determined by extrapolation from the related systems shown in Scheme II, from which Kh K2, and K3 were each estimated to be 60 M™1. The absence of steric or electronic communication between the two ends of the template suggests that K4 and K5 should have the similar values. The value of the self-association constant of the template, Afdim, is 630 M\"1 (vide supra).",

Rate constants were determined by minimizing the least-squares difference be-tween observed and calculated values and also by matching of the calculated and experimental initial rates of reaction. Figure 6 shows the calculated vs experimental formation of template as a function of time. A satisfactory fit was obtained within the limits of the precision of the data.19 (The discrepancy between curve d and the corresponding data points arises from the presence of a small quantity of N-methylated template lib at the beginning of the experiment.)A number of systematic errors limit the accuracy of these rate constants. Notable are variations in temperature, evaporative losses of solvent during prolonged runs, and slow hydrolysis of the ester by adventitious H20. The rate constants were found to fit other reaction conditions only moderately well. The initially observed rate of reaction of 9 and lOd at 1.65 mM was calculated to be 18 times slower than that at 8.2 mM, whereas a 20-fold slower rate was actually observed (Table I). The initially observed(18) The course of the reaction was treated as 100 time increments, At.

Calculations were performed on a Macintosh computer with Microsoft Excel.",
        "(19) An alternative model for the kinetics of self-replicating systems was introduced by von Kiedrowski in 1986. (See refs 5a-c.) In this model, the rate is given as the sum of an autocatalytic term and a background term. The magnitude of the autocatalytic term is proportional to the square root of the total concentration of template, i.e., rate = k,[A]lol[E]lot[T]tot1/2 + *b[A]l0|[E]101. While this model is primarily applicable to systems in which the template predominantly exists as the dimer, such as oligonuclotides, it fits the data presented in the results section quite well. We found the best fit rate constants to be k, = 4 X 10\"2 M\"3/2 s\"1 and kh = 2 X 10\"3 M\"1 s\"1. These values differ substantially from the values kt = 9.87 X 10\"2 M\"3/2 s'1 and kb = 1.24 X 10\"3 M\"1 s\"1, which von Kiedrowski reports for our system (ref 5c). The von Kiedrowski model provides a simple, elegant, and effective means of obtaining the kinetic parameters of autocatalytic systems without the need for equilibrium constants. The model presented in this paper accounts for the mechanistic details of the reaction and for the role of each of the three mechanistic pathways (background bimolecular, preassociative, and template termolecular). This model permits specific predictions about the effects of changes in structure and binding affinities upon the rates of reaction.",

A portion of this discrepancy appears to arise from systematic errors, however. When the same stock solutions of 9 and lOd were used for both the 16 and the 8 mM runs, only a 4.2-fold greater rate was observed. In all cases, the kinetic model predicted the observed trends in reactivity quite well. That some quantitative variations from the model are observed may indicate the limitations of the model, as well as systematic experimental errors. The ratio of the rate constants of an intramolecular reaction and its intermolecular counterpart corresponds to the “effective molarity” of the reacting groups in the intramolecular reaction and thereby provides an index of the efficiency of the intramo-lecular process. Reaction by means of the hydrogen-bonded complexes (AE and AET in eqs 16 and 17) constitutes intra-molecular processes that can be compared to the bimolecular reaction (eq 15). It is interesting to note that the effective mo-larities of the amine and ester groups are actually higher in the termolecular complex AET than in the bimolecular complex AE (k¡/ki = 3.0 M, k2/k{ = 0.16 M). This 19-fold difference in effective molarity may reflect a higher activation energy for formation of the cis conformation of amide 11a from the bimo-lecular complex AE or a more favorable arrangement of functional groups in the termolecular complex AET. It is generally difficult to compare reactions of different orders because of differing trajectories and stereoelectronic effects.20 In spite of the greater effective molarity in the termolecular complex, a large fraction of the product forms by the preassociative bimolecular pathway because of the difference in molecularity of the two processes. Under typical reaction conditions (e.g., 10~2 M concentration of reactants), the concentration of the bimolecular complex far exceeds the concentration of the termolecular complex.

        "Of particular interest is the shape of the product growth curve. In a system in which most of the product forms by an autocatalytic pathway, a sigmoidal growth curve is expected.21 Even so, sig-moidal growth has been difficult to observe in a self-replicating system.3·5·23 Our model predicts that the initial concentration of reactants should substantially affect the shape of the growth curve. At concentrations on the order of 10\"3 M, the contribution of the autocatalytic pathway is insignificant in our system, and the reaction profile is similar to that of the simple bimolecular kinetics (Figure 7a). A slight sigmoidal shape should be observed at initial concentrations in the order of 10\"2 M (Figure 7b). Unfortunately, the degree of sigmoidal curvature is small in comparison to the uncertainty in the data points and is not ob-servable. At concentrations on the order of 10\"1 M, a significantly sigmoidal growth curve is anticipated (Figure 7c). Limitations(21) The occurrence of sigmoidal growth can be established graphically by examining plots of the first or second derivative of [product] vs time (r).

We have also used this model to predict the effects of changes in the rate constants upon the shape of the growth curve (Figure 8). Curve a represents the reaction profile calculated for typical reaction conditions (0.010 M initial concentration of 9 and lOd) with the experimentally determined rate constants (k¡ = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0.0036 min\"1, and k} = 0.070 min\"1). A slight inflection is calculated in this curve, but it is too small to be observed experimentally (vide supra). If the preassociative bi-molecular pathway were not operative (i.e., fc, = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0, and k} = 0.070 min'1), then a highly sigmoidal growth curve b would be observed. For comparison, curve c represents the growth curve in the absence of an autocatalytic mechanism (i.e., kt = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0.0036 min\"1, and k} = 0), and curve d corresponds to reaction by a simple bimolecular mechanism (i.e., k¡ = 0.023 M\"1 min\"1, k2 = 0, and k} = 0). Needless to say, both c and d lack inflection points. Structurally modified mol-ecules in which the electrophile and nucleophile are at a sufficient distance in the base-paired, bimolecular complex such that the preassociative bimolecular pathway is not possible (i.e., k2 = 0) are now in hand. We will report upon these studies in due course. Conclusion and Outlook In this paper we have provided a detailed description of the design, synthesis, and study of a molecular template, 11a, that catalyzes its own formation from simpler components, 9 and lOd. Together, the components and template make up a self-replicating system. Three reaction pathways lead to the formation of template, yet only one, the template termolecular process, is re-sponsible for replication. A kinetic model for the replication process has been developed. Modeling studies indicate that both the preassociative mechanism and the template termolecular process contribute substantially to the formation of template. Calculations predict that a system in which the preassociative mechanism cannot operate will self-replicate efficiently and will exhibit a highly sigmoidal growth curve. The fundamental feature of our self-replicating system is self-complementarity. It may now be easier to visualize other possibilities.22 The fixation on double-stranded nucleic acids is natural, and their catalytic features suggest their originality. What other structures can be considered? We mention two beyond the current system. The first involves hybrid structures of amino acids with nucleic acids. For the second, we have identified naturally occurring peptides that show the requisite structural features.",

Williard3 Contribution from the Department of Chemistry, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, Department of Chemistry, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, and Department of Chemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912. Received March 1, 1991. Revised Manuscript Received July 18, 1991Abstract: The stereoselectivity of the intramolecular photocycloaddition of a series of bicyclic dioxenones has been examined. The selective formation of trans-fused photoadducts is observed in almost all cases, which upon fragmentation lead to the synthesis of bicycloalkanones with an “inside-outside” or trans intrabridgehead stereochemical relationship. This methodology has been applied to the synthesis of several “inside-outside” bicycloalkanones that cannot otherwise be prepared. The unusual reactivity of both the dioxanone photoadducts and the bicycloalkanone fragmentation products is described.",
        "The de Mayo reaction has served as an important example of the utility of enone photocycloaddition chemistry in organic synthesis for almost 30 years. Cycloaddition of the enol of a /3-diketone with an alkene leads to the formation of a cyclobutane, which on fragmentation gives a product containing a 1,5-di-carbonyl moiety.4·5 Since the pioneering studies of  zer6and Pattenden,7 the intramolecular version of this reaction has attracted considerable attention as a powerful method for the construction of structurally complex polycyclic ring systems be-f Dedicated to Professor Ronald C.
