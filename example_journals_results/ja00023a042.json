Thus, the observed rate of energy transfer from 3TPP to C70 would be expected if the C70 triplet energy is 33-35 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with the value of Was-ielewski et al.7 C70, like C60,6 produces singlet oxygen in large quantities, as measured by '02 luminescence at 1268 nm.11 The quantum yield ( )is 0.81 ± 0.15 when excited at both 355 and 532 nm. Since *02 is formed by energy transfer from the highly populated C70 triplet state to molecular oxygen, these values also represent a lower limit for the quantum yield of triplet production ( -r).In excellent agreement with this conclusion, the value for  at355 nm, as determined by comparison with benzophenone (see Ex-perimental Section), were in the range 0.9 ± 0.15 in four separate experiments. Thus SA, the efficiency of formation of '02 from the triplet, is 1.0 within experimental error. We were unable to detect ’02 quenching by C70 in C6D6. Marginal quenching was detected with C60,6 the mechanism of which is presently unknown, but solubility limitations precluded measurements at high enough concentration to detect any quenching by C70, even of the magnitude seen with Cm. As with ¿6Q, however, no destruction of starting material or formation of new products (by UV-visible absorption spectra and HPLC) occurs under 02, following hundreds of laser pulses at either excitation wavelength or with broad-band excitation with a powerful lamp for many hours. Discussion Because of the reduced symmetry of C70 relative to C60, the S0-* S|* transition is not as strongly forbidden, and the visible maxima are much stronger. This lowered forbiddenness also accounts for the fact that weak fluorescence from this transition can be observed in C70, in contrast to C^. Increased triplet-triplet absorption coefficients (roughly 1.5 times that of C6o) may be caused by the same factor. As with C6q, the small S-T splitting in C70 ( £5|_ =9 kcal/mol) is probably a result of the large diameter of the molecule and the resulting small electron-electron repulsion energy.21 This (20) Schmidt, R.; Afshari, E. J. Phys. Chem. 1990, 94, 4377-4378. (21) McGlynn, S. P.; Azumi, T.; Kinoshita, M. Molecular Spectroscopy of the Triplet State·, Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1969. small splitting, the probable low value of the fluorescence rate constant (from the low extinction coefficient), and the expected large spin-orbital interaction in the spheroidal C70 explains why intersystem crossing (ISC) is a dominant process. Wasielewski has measured the rates of intersystem crossing (C6o = 3.0 X 1010 s\"1 and C70 = 8.7 X 109 s'1). The larger diameter and resulting lower curvature of C70 than C6o would predict a smaller spin-orbit coupling and provide a rationale for the lower intersystem crossing rate constant and somewhat lower triplet production efficiency in C7q. The singlet oxygen quantum yields at 532 and 355 nm, while high, are slightly lower than unity. With C6o, the yield is 0.74 at 355 nm, but 1.0 at 532 nm.6 The lower yield for C70 at 532 nm, in comparison with C6q, must result from minor pathways for deactivation of 'C70 other than intersystem crossing, for in-stance, internal conversion. The very high singlet oxygen yield and inertness to destruction of C70 suggests potential for photodynamic damage to biological systems, as with C60.6 Experiments to test this suggestion are in progress.

We have exposed solutions of each in benzene to unfiltered light from a 300-W xenon lamp for many hours under 02 without observable degradation (UV-vis and HPLC). Also, solutions of both compounds were allowed to stand in a California window exposed to full skylight for 9 days; C60 was unchanged, while C70 showed <1% formation of an uniden-tified new product by HPLC.23 We concur that samples on some batches of alumina and on other adsorbents have variable stability, with C70 being lost more readily than C6o, but we do not believe that light is an important contributor to this destruction.

Received December 17, 1990 Abstract: Sources of the methylidene complex of titanocene, Cp2Ti=CH2, react with nitriles in the presence of donor ligands to afford vinylimido titanocene complexes. The vinylimido complexes react readily with ketones, nitriles, and imines, yielding products that retain the elements of the imido ligand. In no case are products of formal [2 + 2] metathesis obtained. Concerted or stepwise [4 + 2] cycloadditions are suggested as possible mechanisms for these coupling reactions. Metal-ligand multiply bonded species play a myriad of diverse roles in inorganic and organometallic chemistry.1 Reports of such complexes as intermediates and isolated species continue to grow in number at a rapid rate. As more and more data are obtained, • University of Oregon. •University of California. it becomes possible to formulate generalizations about the re-activity of these species with various classes of organic substrates. Imido complexes of both early and late transition metals, for example, react with aldehydes and ketones in metathesis-type (1) Nugent, W. A.; Mayer, J. M.

Formation of vinylimido complexes from Cp2Ti=CH2 sources. recently, some doubt has been raised about the viability of me-tallacyclobutene intermediates in these reactions.21 We recently reported the formation of vinylimido complexes of titanocene through the reaction of sources of the methylidene complex of titanocene with nitriles in the presence of trapping ligands (eq 5).22 These imido complexes, the first of titanocene (21) Hofmann, P.; Hámmerle, M.

In sharp contrast to reactions of other imido complexes, they have never been observed to undergo [2 + 2] metathesis reactions with ketones, nitriles, or imines. Instead, as we demonstrate herein, the imido complexes react with these substrates to produce new metallacyclic complexes that retain the original imido group (eq 6). Cp,Ti R'R\"C=E E . O, NR'\" Cp,TL R (6) Results Treatment of titanacyclobutane241 (Figure 1) with 2 equiv of pivalonitrile in benzene at 50 °C for 4 h affords the diazatita-nacyclohexa-2,5-diene 3, which tautomerizes at a somewhat lower rate to the conjugated 2,4-unsaturated isomer 4. The azatita-nacyclobutene 2, previously reported as the initial product of this reaction,25 is in fact not observed; complex 3 is the first observable product.26 Complex 4 is also formed when Tebbe’s reagent27 (Cp2TiCH2*Al(CH3)2Cl, Figure 2) is treated with 2 equiv of pivalonitrile and 1 equiv of a nitrogenous base such as 4-(di-methylamino)pyridine (DMAP). If the amount of pivalonitrile is reduced to 1 equiv and an excess of pyridine or DMAP is used, however, significant amounts of new titanium complexes (5a and 5b) incorporating 1 equiv of the base are also produced (Figure 2). These materials appear to be kinetically labile under these reaction conditions; upon standing, the initially observed mixture of 5a and 3 (ca. 1:2 ratio) is converted to only 3, while the initial 2:1 mixture of 5b and 3 is converted to a 1:2 mixture of the two complexes. In the presence of an excess of trimethylphosphine with only 1 equiv of DMAP (present to scavenge the dimethylaluminum chloride), Tebbe’s reagent yields the trimethylphosphine complex 5c as the sole product (Figure 2). The titanacyclobutane 1 also affords 5c when treated with 1 equiv of pivalonitrile and an excess of trimethylphosphine. Other vinylimido complexes can also be prepared analogously; thus, for example, 1 -cyanoadamantane affords the corresponding adamantyl imido complex 6. .P(CH3), ^ '6 (22) Doxsee, K. M.; Farahi, J. B.

(Average values of bond distances and angles are used in the following discussion.) The 2-aza-6-oxa-1 -titanacyclohexene ring is nearly planar, with only the methylene group twisted appreciably out of planarity. The O-Ti-N angle at 89.6° is only slightly closed down from that seen in simple acyclic titanocene derivatives28 (e.g., the Cl-Ti-Cl angle in Cp2TiCl2 is 95.2°), although it is appreciably larger than that reported for smaller ring titanacyclic complexes (e.g., the C-Ti-C angle in titanacyclobutenes38·29 is ca. 69°). The C(l)-C(2)-C(3) angle at 118.1° is considerably distorted from idealized tetrahedral geometry, perhaps in response to ring strain; the other bond angles at carbon in 7b all appear to be normal. The Ti—O—C and Ti—N=C angles are both quite wide (132.5° (28) Tkachev, V. V.; Atovmyan, L. O. Zh. Strukt. Khim. 1972, 13, 287. (29) Tebbe, F. N.; Harlow, R. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102, 6151-6153. The six atoms within the metallacyclic ring of 10 are very nearly coplanar, with the methylene group lifted only slightly out of the best plane containing these atoms. Addition of a second multiple bond to the metallacyclic ring apparently precludes the significant out-of-plane movement seen for this methylene group in the monounsaturated complex, 7b. The N-Ti-N bond angle at 88.6° is not appreciably different from that seen in 7b (89.6°), and again differs only slightly from that reported for acyclic titanocene derivatives. The C=N bond distances at 1.258 A are consistent with formulation as double bonds (typical length 1.28 A) and inconsistent with single bond character (typical length 1.47 A). The N-C-C bond angles, all falling near 120°, are also consistent with this formulation. The C(l)-C(2)-C(3) angle (118.5°) and the two Ti-N-C angles (132.9° and 133.1°) display distortions similar to those seen for the analogous angles in 7b, again sug-gesting the presence of some ring strain in 10.

However, the tautom-erization is quite slow in the latter reaction mixtures—sequestration of adventitious bases by A1(CH3)2C1 may shut down base-cata-lyzed tautomerization pathways. Similar results are obtained in analogous reactions using 1 -cyanoadamantane in place of pi-valonitrile. The latter reactions were examined in the hopes of adding crystallinity to the reaction products. This hope was realized: complex 10 crystallized from a solution of 6 (vide infra) in which it was a minor component. Crystallographic analysis (Figure 4) confirms the indicated structure for this complex. The 2-azatitanacyclobut-2-ene 2, a possible intermediate in the formation of complex 3, has not yet been directly observed.22·26 Table VI.

However, if Tebbe’s reagent (or tita-nacyclobutane 1) is treated with only 1 equiv of a nitrile in the presence of a donor ligand, such as trimethylphosphine or tri-ethylphosphine, the initial condensation product may be trapped in its ligated ring-opened form (eq 14). Confirmation of the proposed structures for these products was obtained through both spectral analysis and study of their reaction chemistry, as discussed in the following sections.

The NMRspectra of complexes 5a-c and 6 show, as their most characteristic feature, two mutually coupled doublets (2/HH = 1.4-1.8 Hz) for the inequivalent methylene hydrogens. One of the two hydrogens is also weakly coupled to the phosphorus of the phosphine ligand in complexes 5c and 6; this small coupling (5/PH = 1.0 Hz for 5c, 1.1 Hz for 6) disappears in 3lP-decoupled 'H NMR spectra, confirming its assignment as a long-range P-H coupling. These methylene resonances appear at quite high field (e.g., 3.35and 3.85 for 5c; see the Experimental Section for other complexes), and in some cases, in fact, even higher than predicted for typical organic enamines.31 Although the factors affecting chemical shift may be complex,32 it appears that the vinylimido ligand in these com-plexes may be quite electron-rich (vide infra). Other NMRspectral features are also in accord with the formulation of 5a-c and 6 as vinylimido complexes. Single cy-clopentadienyl resonances are observed for each complex (vide infra), with weak P-H coupling seen in the phosphine complexes 5c and 6 (JPH = 2.4 Hz). The ferr-butyl group in 5a-c appears as a sharp singlet at ca. 1.3 ppm, while the complexed PMe3 of 5c and 6 appears as a phosphorus-coupled doublet near  1.0.(Observation of this P-H coupling, 2J?h ~ 6-9 Hz, confirms the presence of complexed PMe3; free PMe3 under our experimental (31) Pascual, C.; Meier, J.; Simon, W. Helv. Chim. Acta 1966, 49, 164. (32) For example, see: Drago, R. S. Physical Methods in Chemistry·, W. B. Saunders: Philadelphia, 1977; pp 283-294. Vinylimido Complexes of Titanocene J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 113, No. 23, 1991 8895 conditions appears as a broad singlet, with incompletely resolved P-H coupling.) Identifiable resonances for the complexed pyridine and DMAP ligands in 5a and 5b, respectively, have not been observed. Apparently, exchange of these more weakly bound ligands with excess ligand in solution is rapid, resulting in the appearance of only exchange-averaged signals. The l3C NMR spectra of 5c and 6 are completely consistent with the proposed structures. Again, single cyclopentadienyl resonances are observed (VCH = 170 Hz), even in the phosphine complexes. (Nonobservable P-C coupling in CpTi-phosphine complexes is well precedented.33) The methylene carbon of 5c appears as an AMNX pattern (VCH] == VCH2 = 155 Hz, *JK = 4.9 Hz) at  84.3;both the chemical shift and the magnitude of the C-H coupling constant support its assignment as an olefinic carbon. Adamantyl complex 6 displays an analogous resonance for its methylene carbon. Other resonances, C-H coupling con-stants, and P-C coupling constants provide confirmatory support as well. For example, the VCP coupling constants follow a distance order analogous to that observed in alkylcarbene complexes of titanocene bearing phosphine ligands.33·34 Finally, the coordinated phosphine on complexes 5c and 6 gives rise to a single, sharp resonance in their proton-decoupled 3IP NMR spectra. Alternative formulation of 5c and 6 as PMe3 complexes of the corresponding azatitanacyclobutenes (2) is ruled out by the magnitude of VHh for the methylene group (1.4-1.8 Hz observed vs ca. 12-15 Hz expected for a CH2 group or ca. 2 Hz for a =CH2 group) and by the magnitude of '/Ch for the methylene group (155 Hz), which are consistent with a =CH2 group but not a CH2. The observed pattern of long-range P-C coupling constants also appears inconsistent with the azatitanacyclobutene formulation. Finally, a nonplanar geometry for the azatitanacyclobutene would be required for it to display two distinct resonances for the methylene hydrogens. Such a geometry would also give rise to two distinct cyclopentadienyl resonances, yet only one such res-onance is resolved by both  and13C NMR spectroscopy. The observation of chemically equivalent cyclopentadienyl rings for the vinylimido complexes suggests that the imido ligand in these complexes is linear. Analogous linear imido ligand geometry has been defined by X-ray crystallography for simple alkyl-and aryl-substituted imido complexes of zirconium,30·35 vanadium,36\"38 and osmium.39 We will discuss the bonding implications of this geometry further in a subsequent paper. Reactivity. Vinylimido complexes 5c and 6 react with acetone, benzylideneaniline, and nitriles to form new metallacyclic products that incorporate the vinylimido ligand. For example, their re-actions with acetone produce 2-aza-6-oxa-1 -titanacyclohex-2-enes 7a and 7b in high yield. Spectral analysis suggests the proposed structures for these complexes, and the structure of 7b has been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis (Figure 3). Chemical confirmation for these structures is provided by their protonolysis to afford, after hydrolysis, the anticipated 0-hydroxy ketones 8a and 8b. The nonbasic nature of the titanium methylidene reagents and the use of readily preparable nitriles in place of ketones or aldehydes in these reaction sequences suggest that this chemistry may function as a useful, completely directed, aldol reaction equivalent. Similarly, complex 5c reacts with benzylideneaniline to afford the diazatitanacycle 9a, while analogous treatment of 6 affords metallacycle 9b. Nitriles also couple with the vinylimido complexes; for example, addition of 1-cyanoadamantane to 6 (33) Gilliom, L. R.; Grubbs, R. H. Organometallics 1986, 5, 721-724.

Further details of the symmetrical and unsymmetrical coupling of unsaturated organic substrates, including nitriles, ketones, and ¡mines, with the vi-nylimido complexes will be presented at a later time. Interestingly, the vinylimido complex 5c does not appear to react with alkynes even after prolonged reaction times. In contrast, Bergman’s zirconocene imido complex reacts readily with alkynes to afford azazirconacyclobutenes.40 These reactions are especially noteworthy in that they constitute the first report of reaction chemistry of a transition metal imido complex with such substrates not proceeding through a formal [2 + 2] reaction pathway. The acetone reaction provides the most dramatic illustration of this most unusual reactivity. In all reported reactions of transition metal imido complexes with ketones, facile [2 + 2] cycloaddition followed by fragmentation to afford the corresponding metal oxo complex is observed (eq 1). In sharp contrast, the titanocene vinylimido complexes, 5c and 6, do not yield any [Cp2Ti=0]„ in their reactions with acetone, even though formation of this very stable, oligomeric oxide could be expected to provide a strong driving force for the [2 + 2] reaction. Rather, 5c and 6 react to give six-membered ring products in which the imido nitrogen is still attached to titanium. Several possible reaction paths for these coupling reactions are suggested in Figure 5. Path A, direct insertion of nitrile (or ketone or ¡mine) into the Ti-C bond of an intermediate azatitanacy-clobutene, parallels reported reaction chemistry of titanacyclo-butenes.41·42 Alternatively, the vinylimido complex could condense directly with the reacting nitrile (or ketone or imine), perhaps through either a concerted or a stepwise [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction (path B),43 a reaction path resembling that proposed for (40) Lack of reactivity of the imido ligand with alkynes is not unique, however. For example, several tantalum imido complexes have been reported to coordinate alkynes to give imido complexes bearing alkyne ligands, but these coordinated alkynes do not appear to react further with the imido ligand itself. For example, see: Chao, Y.-W.; Wexler, P. A.; Wigley, D. E. Inorg. Chem. 1989, 28, 3860-3868. (41) Doxsee, K. M.; Mouser, J. K. M. Organometallics 1990, 9, 3012-3014. (42) Meinhart, J. D.; Grubbs, R.

(43) Though no such [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of a “metalladiene\" has been firmly documented, we note recent reports that were reasonably proposed as possibly proceeding via such cycloadditions: (a) Dragisich, V.; Murray, C.

Conclusions Reactions of nitriles with the titanocene methylidene complex in the presence of good donor ligands readily produce vinylimido complexes. These vinylimido complexes couple efficiently with unsaturated organic substrates (ketones, nitriles, and imines) to afford new metallacycles, formal [4 + 2] cycloadducts, which retain all the elements of the vinylimido ligand. In contrast to the reactivity of other reported imido complexes, no [2 + 2] cycloaddition products or complexes derived from such products have been observed. Experimental Section All manipulations of air-and/or moisture-sensitive compounds were performed using glovebox or standard Schlenk line techniques.46 Argon used in Schlenk work was purified by passage through columns of BASF Catalyst R3-11 (regenerated by passage of 90% nitrogen and 10% hy-drogen-forming gas) and 4-Á molecular sieves (Linde, activated in vacuo at 250 °C). Compounds were stored in a nitrogen-filled Vacuum At-mospheres glovebox equipped with an MO-40-1 purification Dri-Train. NMR spectra were recorded in dry, deoxygenated C6D6 or toluene-d8 unless otherwise indicated. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million ( )referenced to residual protons or carbons of solvent. 3IP NMR data are referenced to external 85% H3P04. Glassware was dried by heating at 140 °C for at least 1 h and cooling to room temperature under vacuum or a flow of argon. All NMR sam-ples were prepared in the drybox and capped with rubber septa or Teflon stopcocks and then flame sealed outside the drybox under nitrogen or vacuum. Materials. Benzene, toluene, and diethyl ether were dried and deox-ygenated over either sodium/benzophenone or NaK/benzophenone ketyl. Pentane was stirred over concentrated H2S04, washed with H20, dried over CaH2, and then dried and deoxygenated over either sodium/ benzophenone or NaK/benzophenone ketyl, with ca. 1% tetraglyme present to solubilize the ketyl. Dried degassed solvents were vacuum transferred into dry glass vessels equipped with Teflon valve closures and stored under argon or, alternatively, kept in solvent stills under nitrogen. Benzene-</6 and toluene-i/8 were dried, deoxygenated, and vacuum transferred from sodium/benzophenone ketyl. Deuterated solvents were stored in the glovebox. Cp2TiCH2,AI(CH3)2CI (Tebbe’s reagent) and l,l-bis(n5-cyclo-pentadienyl)-3-?iv7-butyl-1 -titanacyclobutane were prepared by reported procedures.47 4-(/V,(V-Dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, Aldrich) was recrystallized from toluene and dried under vacuum. Trimethylphosphine was kept in the glovebox and used as received (Aldrich) with no further purification. Pivalonitrile was dried over CaH2, deoxygenated, and vacuum transferred. 1-Cyanoadamantane (Aldrich) was recrystallized from ethanol and dried under vacuum. Formation of Cp2TI=NC[C(CH3)3]=CH2-Pyridine (5a). Cp2TiCH2\"AI(CH3)2Cl (10 mg, 0.0351 mmol) was dissolved in 0.5 g of toluene-<y8. Pivalonitrile (3.90 µ ,0.0351 mmol) and pyridine (8.50 pL, 0.105 mmol) were added to this solution simultaneously. The NMR tube was then sealed under nitrogen, and the reaction was followed by NMR spectroscopy at room temperature. After 20 min, a 1:2 mixture of the vinylimido complex 5a and untautomerized diaza complex 3 was ob-served. isolation of pure 5a from these reaction mixtures has not yet proved possible.

The coordinated DMAP apparently exchanges with free DMAP and with DMAP-A1(CH3)2C1, resulting in exchange-broadened resonances. Preparation of Cp2Ti=NC[C(CH3)3]=CH2 P(CH3)3 (5c) from Cp2TiCH2-Al(CH3)2Cl. A solution of pivalonitrile (0.146 g, 1.76 mmol), DMAP (0.2146 g, 1.756 mmol), and trimethylphosphine (0.730 mL, 7.06 mmol) in 6 mL of benzene was added to a solution of 2    2· 1-(CH3)2C1 (0.500 g, 1.76 mmol) in 4 mL of benzene. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and then frozen in an ice-salt bath. Following the removal of solvent from the frozen sample in vacuo, the remaining solid was dissolved in pentane. This dark-red solution was cooled to -35 °C, filtered to remove the pale-colored DMAP-aluminum adduct, and evaporated under reduced pressure at -35 °C to afford 5c as a dark-red solid in essentially quantitative yield. This material is ca. 90-95% pure, with the major contaminant being diazatitanacyclo-hexadiene complex 3. Full characterization of 5c is provided below. In small-scale reactions carried out in benzene-d6 and followed by  NMRspectroscopy, analysis after ca. 15 min of reaction time showed a mixture of vinylimido complex 5c and the trimethylphosphine complex of Cp2Ti=CH2.48 After an additional 3-6 h at room temperature, con-version to 5c was complete. Preparation of Cp2Ti=NQC(CH3)3]=CH2P(CH3)3 (5c) from 1,1-Bis(7|5-cyclopentadienyl)-3-fert-butyl-l-titanacyclobutane. Trimethyl-phosphine (75 pL, 0.72 mmol) was added to a solution of the titanacy-clobutane (50.0 mg, 0.181 mmol) and pivalonitrile (15.0 mg, 0.181 mmol) in 3 mL of benzene. This mixture was heated in a closed Schlenk tube at 55 °C for ca. 12 h, occasionally venting the tube to the argon manifold to prevent any pressure buildup. The dark-red solution was then frozen in an ice-salt bath, and all volatiles were removed in vacuo, af-fording a microcrystalline, dark-red solid (54 mg, 85%).

None of this higher mass material is seen in the mass spectra ob-tained after shorter periods of heating, and we believe it is only formed upon pyrolysis of the sample in the mass spectrometer inlet port.

Vinylimido complex 5c was generated in solution by the reaction of titanacyclobutane 1 (10.0 mg, 0.0362 mmol), pivalonitrile (3.00 mg, 0.0361 mmol), and trimethyl-phosphine (15.0 µ _,0.145 mmol) in 0.5 g of C6D6. Pivalonitrile (4.00 mL, 0.0362 mmol) was added to this solution, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by NMR spectroscopy. In the presence of excess trimethylphosphine, the reaction is very slow and no tautomerized di-azatitanacyclohexadiene, complex 4, is observed. Even after heating the reaction mixture for 3 days at 75 eC only a mixture of the vinylimido complex 5c and the diazatitanacyclohexadiene complex 3 is observed. If the reaction of pivalonitrile with the vinylimido complex 5c is carried out in the absence of excess phosphine, the vinylimido complex is converted to the untautomerized complex 3 in about 24 h at room temperature. This complex was converted to the tautomerized isomer, 4, by continuous heating at 45 °C for 15 days.

        "of the donor is 0-2 kcal/mol below that of the acceptor, the rate constant is more than 2 orders of magnitude below the diffu-sion-controlled value. Thus, the observed rate of energy transfer from 3TPP to C70 would be expected if the C70 triplet energy is 33-35 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with the value of Was-ielewski et al.7C70, like C60,6 produces singlet oxygen in large quantities, as measured by '02 luminescence at 1268 nm.11 The quantum yield ( )is 0.81 ± 0.15 when excited at both 355 and 532 nm. Since *02 is formed by energy transfer from the highly populated C70 triplet state to molecular oxygen, these values also represent a lower limit for the quantum yield of triplet production ( -r).In excellent agreement with this conclusion, the value for  at355 nm, as determined by comparison with benzophenone (see Ex-perimental Section), were in the range 0.9 ± 0.15 in four separate experiments. Thus SA, the efficiency of formation of '02 from the triplet, is 1.0 within experimental error.",
        "We were unable to detect ’02 quenching by C70 in C6D6. Marginal quenching was detected with C60,6 the mechanism of which is presently unknown, but solubility limitations precluded measurements at high enough concentration to detect any quenching by C70, even of the magnitude seen with Cm. As with ¿6Q, however, no destruction of starting material or formation of new products (by UV-visible absorption spectra and HPLC) occurs under 02, following hundreds of laser pulses at either excitation wavelength or with broad-band excitation with a powerful lamp for many hours. DiscussionBecause of the reduced symmetry of C70 relative to C60, the S0-* S|* transition is not as strongly forbidden, and the visible maxima are much stronger. This lowered forbiddenness also accounts for the fact that weak fluorescence from this transition can be observed in C70, in contrast to C^. Increased triplet-triplet absorption coefficients (roughly 1.5 times that of C6o) may be caused by the same factor.",
        "As with C6q, the small S-T splitting in C70 ( £5|_ =9 kcal/mol) is probably a result of the large diameter of the molecule and the resulting small electron-electron repulsion energy.21 This(20) Schmidt, R.; Afshari, E.

Molecular Spectroscopy of the Triplet State·, Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1969. small splitting, the probable low value of the fluorescence rate constant (from the low extinction coefficient), and the expected large spin-orbital interaction in the spheroidal C70 explains why intersystem crossing (ISC) is a dominant process. Wasielewski has measured the rates of intersystem crossing (C6o = 3.0 X 1010 s\"1 and C70 = 8.7 X 109 s'1). The larger diameter and resulting lower curvature of C70 than C6o would predict a smaller spin-orbit coupling and provide a rationale for the lower intersystem crossing rate constant and somewhat lower triplet production efficiency in C7q.",
        "The singlet oxygen quantum yields at 532 and 355 nm, while high, are slightly lower than unity. With C6o, the yield is 0.74 at 355 nm, but 1.0 at 532 nm.6 The lower yield for C70 at 532 nm, in comparison with C6q, must result from minor pathways for deactivation of 'C70 other than intersystem crossing, for in-stance, internal conversion.",
        "The very high singlet oxygen yield and inertness to destruction of C70 suggests potential for photodynamic damage to biological systems, as with C60.6 Experiments to test this suggestion are in progress.",

        "Note Added in Proof. A recent letter22 suggests that Ceo and C70 are unstable to light. We have exposed solutions of each in benzene to unfiltered light from a 300-W xenon lamp for many hours under 02 without observable degradation (UV-vis and HPLC). Also, solutions of both compounds were allowed to stand in a California window exposed to full skylight for 9 days; C60 was unchanged, while C70 showed <1% formation of an uniden-tified new product by HPLC.23 We concur that samples on some batches of alumina and on other adsorbents have variable stability, with C70 being lost more readily than C6o, but we do not believe that light is an important contributor to this destruction.",

The azatita-nacyclobutene 2, previously reported as the initial product of this reaction,25 is in fact not observed; complex 3 is the first observable product.26 Complex 4 is also formed when Tebbe’s reagent27 (Cp2TiCH2*Al(CH3)2Cl, Figure 2) is treated with 2 equiv of pivalonitrile and 1 equiv of a nitrogenous base such as 4-(di-methylamino)pyridine (DMAP). If the amount of pivalonitrile is reduced to 1 equiv and an excess of pyridine or DMAP is used, however, significant amounts of new titanium complexes (5a and 5b) incorporating 1 equiv of the base are also produced (Figure 2). These materials appear to be kinetically labile under these reaction conditions; upon standing, the initially observed mixture of 5a and 3 (ca. 1:2 ratio) is converted to only 3, while the initial 2:1 mixture of 5b and 3 is converted to a 1:2 mixture of the two complexes.",

The 2-aza-6-oxa-1 -titanacyclohexene ring is nearly planar, with only the methylene group twisted appreciably out of planarity. The O-Ti-N angle at 89.6° is only slightly closed down from that seen in simple acyclic titanocene derivatives28 (e.g., the Cl-Ti-Cl angle in Cp2TiCl2 is 95.2°), although it is appreciably larger than that reported for smaller ring titanacyclic complexes (e.g., the C-Ti-C angle in titanacyclobutenes38·29 is ca. 69°). The C(l)-C(2)-C(3) angle at 118.1° is considerably distorted from idealized tetrahedral geometry, perhaps in response to ring strain; the other bond angles at carbon in 7b all appear to be normal.

        "The six atoms within the metallacyclic ring of 10 are very nearly coplanar, with the methylene group lifted only slightly out of the best plane containing these atoms. Addition of a second multiple bond to the metallacyclic ring apparently precludes the significant out-of-plane movement seen for this methylene group in the monounsaturated complex, 7b. The N-Ti-N bond angle at 88.6° is not appreciably different from that seen in 7b (89.6°), and again differs only slightly from that reported for acyclic titanocene derivatives. The C=N bond distances at 1.258 A are consistent with formulation as double bonds (typical length 1.28 A) and inconsistent with single bond character (typical length 1.47 A). The N-C-C bond angles, all falling near 120°, are also consistent with this formulation. The C(l)-C(2)-C(3) angle (118.5°) and the two Ti-N-C angles (132.9° and 133.1°) display distortions similar to those seen for the analogous angles in 7b, again sug-gesting the presence of some ring strain in 10.

However, if Tebbe’s reagent (or tita-nacyclobutane 1) is treated with only 1 equiv of a nitrile in the presence of a donor ligand, such as trimethylphosphine or tri-ethylphosphine, the initial condensation product may be trapped in its ligated ring-opened form (eq 14).

The NMRspectra of complexes 5a-c and 6 show, as their most characteristic feature, two mutually coupled doublets (2/HH = 1.4-1.8 Hz) for the inequivalent methylene hydrogens. One of the two hydrogens is also weakly coupled to the phosphorus of the phosphine ligand in complexes 5c and 6; this small coupling (5/PH = 1.0 Hz for 5c, 1.1 Hz for 6) disappears in 3lP-decoupled 'H NMR spectra, confirming its assignment as a long-range P-H coupling. These methylene resonances appear at quite high field (e.g., 3.35and 3.85 for 5c; see the Experimental Section for other complexes), and in some cases, in fact, even higher than predicted for typical organic enamines.31 Although the factors affecting chemical shift may be complex,32 it appears that the vinylimido ligand in these com-plexes may be quite electron-rich (vide infra).",
        "Other NMRspectral features are also in accord with the formulation of 5a-c and 6 as vinylimido complexes. Single cy-clopentadienyl resonances are observed for each complex (vide infra), with weak P-H coupling seen in the phosphine complexes 5c and 6 (JPH = 2.4 Hz). The ferr-butyl group in 5a-c appears as a sharp singlet at ca. 1.3 ppm, while the complexed PMe3 of 5c and 6 appears as a phosphorus-coupled doublet near  1.0.(Observation of this P-H coupling, 2J?h ~ 6-9 Hz, confirms the presence of complexed PMe3; free PMe3 under our experimental(31) Pascual, C.; Meier, J.; Simon, W.

Identifiable resonances for the complexed pyridine and DMAP ligands in 5a and 5b, respectively, have not been observed. Apparently, exchange of these more weakly bound ligands with excess ligand in solution is rapid, resulting in the appearance of only exchange-averaged signals.",
        "The l3C NMR spectra of 5c and 6 are completely consistent with the proposed structures. Again, single cyclopentadienyl resonances are observed (VCH = 170 Hz), even in the phosphine complexes. (Nonobservable P-C coupling in CpTi-phosphine complexes is well precedented.33) The methylene carbon of 5c appears as an AMNX pattern (VCH] == VCH2 = 155 Hz, *JK = 4.9 Hz) at  84.3;both the chemical shift and the magnitude of the C-H coupling constant support its assignment as an olefinic carbon. Adamantyl complex 6 displays an analogous resonance for its methylene carbon. Other resonances, C-H coupling con-stants, and P-C coupling constants provide confirmatory support as well. For example, the VCP coupling constants follow a distance order analogous to that observed in alkylcarbene complexes of titanocene bearing phosphine ligands.33·34 Finally, the coordinated phosphine on complexes 5c and 6 gives rise to a single, sharp resonance in their proton-decoupled 3IP NMR spectra.",
        "Alternative formulation of 5c and 6 as PMe3 complexes of the corresponding azatitanacyclobutenes (2) is ruled out by the magnitude of VHh for the methylene group (1.4-1.8 Hz observed vs ca. 12-15 Hz expected for a CH2 group or ca. 2 Hz for a =CH2 group) and by the magnitude of '/Ch for the methylene group (155 Hz), which are consistent with a =CH2 group but not a CH2. The observed pattern of long-range P-C coupling constants also appears inconsistent with the azatitanacyclobutene formulation. Finally, a nonplanar geometry for the azatitanacyclobutene would be required for it to display two distinct resonances for the methylene hydrogens. Such a geometry would also give rise to two distinct cyclopentadienyl resonances, yet only one such res-onance is resolved by both  and13C NMR spectroscopy.",
        "The observation of chemically equivalent cyclopentadienyl rings for the vinylimido complexes suggests that the imido ligand in these complexes is linear. Analogous linear imido ligand geometry has been defined by X-ray crystallography for simple alkyl-and aryl-substituted imido complexes of zirconium,30·35 vanadium,36\"38 and osmium.39 We will discuss the bonding implications of this geometry further in a subsequent paper.",
        "Reactivity. Vinylimido complexes 5c and 6 react with acetone, benzylideneaniline, and nitriles to form new metallacyclic products that incorporate the vinylimido ligand. For example, their re-actions with acetone produce 2-aza-6-oxa-1 -titanacyclohex-2-enes 7a and 7b in high yield. Spectral analysis suggests the proposed structures for these complexes, and the structure of 7b has been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis (Figure 3). Chemical confirmation for these structures is provided by their protonolysis to afford, after hydrolysis, the anticipated 0-hydroxy ketones 8a and 8b. The nonbasic nature of the titanium methylidene reagents and the use of readily preparable nitriles in place of ketones or aldehydes in these reaction sequences suggest that this chemistry may function as a useful, completely directed, aldol reaction equivalent. Similarly, complex 5c reacts with benzylideneaniline to afford the diazatitanacycle 9a, while analogous treatment of 6 affords metallacycle 9b. Nitriles also couple with the vinylimido complexes; for example, addition of 1-cyanoadamantane to 6(33) Gilliom, L. R.; Grubbs, R. H. Organometallics 1986, 5, 721-724.

Further details of the symmetrical and unsymmetrical coupling of unsaturated organic substrates, including nitriles, ketones, and ¡mines, with the vi-nylimido complexes will be presented at a later time. Interestingly, the vinylimido complex 5c does not appear to react with alkynes even after prolonged reaction times. In contrast, Bergman’s zirconocene imido complex reacts readily with alkynes to afford azazirconacyclobutenes.40These reactions are especially noteworthy in that they constitute the first report of reaction chemistry of a transition metal imido complex with such substrates not proceeding through a formal [2 + 2] reaction pathway. The acetone reaction provides the most dramatic illustration of this most unusual reactivity. In all reported reactions of transition metal imido complexes with ketones, facile [2 + 2] cycloaddition followed by fragmentation to afford the corresponding metal oxo complex is observed (eq 1). In sharp contrast, the titanocene vinylimido complexes, 5c and 6, do not yield any [Cp2Ti=0]„ in their reactions with acetone, even though formation of this very stable, oligomeric oxide could be expected to provide a strong driving force for the [2 + 2] reaction. Rather, 5c and 6 react to give six-membered ring products in which the imido nitrogen is still attached to titanium.",
        "Several possible reaction paths for these coupling reactions are suggested in Figure 5. Path A, direct insertion of nitrile (or ketone or ¡mine) into the Ti-C bond of an intermediate azatitanacy-clobutene, parallels reported reaction chemistry of titanacyclo-butenes.41·42 Alternatively, the vinylimido complex could condense directly with the reacting nitrile (or ketone or imine), perhaps through either a concerted or a stepwise [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction (path B),43 a reaction path resembling that proposed for(40) Lack of reactivity of the imido ligand with alkynes is not unique, however. For example, several tantalum imido complexes have been reported to coordinate alkynes to give imido complexes bearing alkyne ligands, but these coordinated alkynes do not appear to react further with the imido ligand itself.

ConclusionsReactions of nitriles with the titanocene methylidene complex in the presence of good donor ligands readily produce vinylimido complexes. These vinylimido complexes couple efficiently with unsaturated organic substrates (ketones, nitriles, and imines) to afford new metallacycles, formal [4 + 2] cycloadducts, which retain all the elements of the vinylimido ligand.

        "Formation of Complexes 3 and 4 from 5c. Vinylimido complex 5c was generated in solution by the reaction of titanacyclobutane 1 (10.0 mg, 0.0362 mmol), pivalonitrile (3.00 mg, 0.0361 mmol), and trimethyl-phosphine (15.0 µ _,0.145 mmol) in 0.5 g of C6D6. Pivalonitrile (4.00 mL, 0.0362 mmol) was added to this solution, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by NMR spectroscopy. In the presence of excess trimethylphosphine, the reaction is very slow and no tautomerized di-azatitanacyclohexadiene, complex 4, is observed. Even after heating the reaction mixture for 3 days at 75 eC only a mixture of the vinylimido complex 5c and the diazatitanacyclohexadiene complex 3 is observed. If the reaction of pivalonitrile with the vinylimido complex 5c is carried out in the absence of excess phosphine, the vinylimido complex is converted to the untautomerized complex 3 in about 24 h at room temperature. This complex was converted to the tautomerized isomer, 4, by continuous heating at 45 °C for 15 days.

        "X-ray Analysis of 10. Crystal data are presented in Table I. Data were collected at 130 K on a Siemens R3m/V diffractometer using Mo Ka radiation ( =0.71073 Á) with a highly oriented graphite crystal monochromator for 2 =0.0-46.0°, using a constant scanspeed of 58.6° min\"1 and an scanrange of 1.00° over the index ranges 0 < h ¿ 12, -17 < k < 1, -18 5 / < 18, giving 8997 independent reflections [4569 reflections with 1 > 3 (/)].Background measurements were performed with a stationary crystal and a stationary counter at ±1.00° offsets from peak, each for 50.0% of the total scan time. Two standard reflections were measured every 198 reflections. Solution and refinement details are summarized in Table VI. Two molecules of the complex make up the asymmetric unit. Final atomic coordinates and equivalent iso-tropic displacement coefficients are presented in Table VII, and repre-sentative bond lengths and angles are presented in Tables VIII and IX.
