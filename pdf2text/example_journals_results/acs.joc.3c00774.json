The newly designed chiral building block was subjected to the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, Petasis reaction, and selenylation reaction, respectively, and all these reactions worked well to afford the corresponding 6′-functionalized hydroquinines with satisfactory results, demonstrating its extraordinary application potency.  INTRODUCTION Arylboronic acids are highly active molecules that serve as the most essential building blocks in organic synthesis.1 In the past decades, arylboronic acids participated in several significant types of coupling reaction, such as Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction,2 Chan-Lam reaction,3 Liebeskind-Srogl reaction,4 Petasis reaction,5 P-arylation,6 and selenylation,7 leading to the construction of numerous valuable com-pounds�medicines, catalysts, natural products, and pesti-cides.8 Cinchona alkaloids, extracted from the bark of Cinchona of f icinalis, represent the most well-known natural products with quinine as a prominent member.9 As early as the 17th century, cinchona alkaloids had been widely utilized for the treatment of malaria.10 Additionally, they were recognized to exhibit a diverse spectrum of bioactivities like antineoplastic,11 antimicrobial,12 anti-inflammatory,13 and analgesic14 behaviors. On the other hand, a myriad of chiral organocatalysts have been created to facilitate the asymmetric synthesis of truly precious, optically pure molecules over the course of the past two decades, with cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives standing out as the most important members amidst them.15 Currently, the structural transformations of cinchona alkaloids primarily include three aspects (Figure 1): (i) quinuclidine isomerization,16 terminal olefin conversion,17 and quaterniza-tion;18 (ii) conversions of secondary hydroxyl group at C-9 position comprising halogenation,19 arylation,20 amination,21 hydroxyl protection,22 and oxidation;23 and (iii) structural modification of the quinoline-ring system at C-2′, 5′, 6′, 7′, and 8′ positions.24 It is noteworthy that the functionalization of the C-6′ position is crucial, as the group at this position often interacts with the quinuclidine moiety, greatly affecting the biological activity or catalytic performance of cinchona alkaloids. Several studies focused on quinine or its derivatives to realize alkylation,25 amination,26 fluorination,27 sulfona-tion,28 and etherification29 at the C-6′ position for catalytic or pharmaceutical applications, predominantly due to the presence of convenient handles and the relatively lower cost compared to other cinchona alkaloids. Despite the seminal functionalization presented, it is still necessary to further adorn quinine and its derivatives at their C-6′ position, thus accessing molecular diversity to meet the exuberant demand from drug discovery and asymmetric catalysis. In this work, hydroquinine-6′-boric acid was first synthesized via a palladium-catalyzed borylation/silica gel promoted hydrolysis sequence of hydroquinine-derived triflate30 and bis(pinacolato)diboron. The successful introduction of the boric acid group to the C-6′ position of the quinoline ring bestowed infinite possibilities on the functionalization of hydroquinine. To demonstrate its application potency, hydro-quinine-6′-boric acid was involved in a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling with aryl bromides, achieving the decoration of hydroquinine effectively. Multicomponent reactions were widely used as complexity-generating tactics to rapidly Received: April 8, 2023 Notepubs.acs.org/joc © XXXX American Chemical Society A https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.3c00774 J.

Organoselenium compounds are a pivotal class of entities owing to their multitudinous applications in the realm of catalysis, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.32 Accordingly, we explored a CuO nano-particles catalyzed coupling reaction of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid and dialkyl diselenides, and this reaction granted a series of distinctive hydroquinine-selenides.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initially, the palladium-catalyzed borylation reaction of hydro-quinine-derived triflate 1 and bis(pinacolato)diboron 2 was conducted in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 with triphenylphos-phine (PPh3) as a ligand and Cs2CO3 as a base in 1,4-dioxane (moisture content = 0.15%) under argon ambient, but no reaction was observed after being stirred at 80 °C for 8 h (Table 1, entry 1). The same result was obtained when the inorganic base was replaced with NaOAc (entry 2). Fortunately, the reaction occurred smoothly to generate a new compound in 4 h, employing KOAc as the base (entry 3). However, the polarity of the compound was much larger than that of 1, making us doubt whether the compound was hydroquinine-6′-borate. The structural characterization deter-mined that the compound gained was hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 (30% yield). PdCl2 exhibited lower catalytic activity, and only a 21% yield of product was obtained after 7 h (entry 4). Another ligand led to a worse result, as shown by the application of 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) (entry 5). The catalytic activity of NiCl2 combined with 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) was tested, but it could not drive the reaction (entry 6). The solvents were screened, including toluene, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and acetonitrile (entries 7-9). The use of acetonitrile (moisture content = 0.04%) as the solvent not only shortened the reaction time but also greatly increased the yield of product (entry 9). Subsequently, we estimated the effect of the loading amount of catalyst and ligand on the reaction. It was found that 3 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 together with 12 mol % of PPh3 could still promote the reaction, affording the product in a slightly higher yield albeit with a prolonged reaction time (entry 10 vs entry 9). However, the catalytic efficiency dropped sharply using 1 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 (entry 11). Reducing the amount of inorganic base was also detrimental to the reaction (entry 12). Finally, we checked the impact of the stoichiometry of the substrates on the reaction. Decreasing the amount of bis(pinacolato)diboron 2 resulted in slight erosion of the yield (entries 13 and 14 vs entry 10). To show the synthetic potential of this protocol, a preparative-scale synthesis of 3 was executed. Up to 10.0 mmol of 1 reacted with 2 smoothly under the optimized reaction conditions to provide the desired product 3 in maintained yield (entry 15). A single cuboid crystal of triflate monohydrate of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 was obtained by recrystallization from a petroleum ether/ethyl acetate system, and the absolute configuration of 3 was established by X-ray crystallographic analysis (CCDC number: 2141376).33 To probe the reaction mechanism, a borylation reaction which experienced anhydrous, moist, and silica gel-containing stages sequentially was monitored by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (see SI for details). The spectra of HRMS implied that (i) the hydroquinine-6′-borate hardly underwent in situ hydrolysis in the borylation process, even if there was a high moisture content in the reaction system; and (ii) silica gel was able to promote the hydrolysis of hydroquinine-6′-borate to generate hydroquinine-6′-boric acid. The results of the subsequent controlled experiments (Table 2) further substantiated the hydrolysis of hydroquinine-6′-borate during the purification process through column chromatography on silica gel. Another vital piece of evidence was that hydroquinine-6′-borate was not observed at all on the silica gel plate when monitoring the reaction by thin-layer chromatography. Thus, it was a palladium-catalyzed boryla-tion/silica gel promoted hydrolysis sequence that realized the construction of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid. With hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 in hand, we first examined the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of 3 with 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene 4a under the conditions we established previously (Table 3).34 The reaction proceeded smoothly to produce the desired product 5a as a mixture of rotamers with a 62% yield and a 67:33 rotameric ratio (rr) within 4 h. Without further optimization of reaction conditions, we sought to assess the scope and generality of the reaction with respect to multifarious aryl bromides. Polyaromatic bromine (4b) was tolerated to forge 5b with an acceptable yield and rr value. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles as the basic scaffolds are present in more than half of all marketed drugs.35 Thus, heteroaryl bromides with pyridine-2-yl (4c), pyridine-3-yl (4d), quinoline-4-yl (4e), and indole-5-yl (4f) groups were evaluated. Substrates 4c and 4d appeared to be a little sluggish, taking more time to deliver the coupling products 5c and 5d in moderate yields. Note that the rotamers of 5c and 5d were not observed. Importantly, quinoline-4-yl (4e) and indole-5-yl (4f) groups could be introduced to the C-6′ position of hydroquinine with satisfactory results (5e and 5f). 5-Bromo isatin 4g was an appropriate substrate to furnish the target product 5g in 40% yield without a rotamer. Attempts to expand this catalytic chemistry to the oxygen-containing heteroaromatic bromides, such as 6-bromo-4H-chromen-4-one 4h and 3-bromodibenzo[b,d]furan 4i, were also successful. Afterward, hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 was subjected to the Petasis reaction with piperidine 6 and salicylaldehyde 7a as the partners. Without the catalyst, the reaction could proceed at 100 °C to unveil the coupling product 8a with a 54% yield and 71:29 rr (Table 4). We then examined the scope of the reaction regarding a range of salicylaldehydes under the original conditions. This reaction was compatible with 4-methoxy substitution (7b), resulting in the generation of desired product 8b with a 45% yield and 77:23 rr. The salicylaldehydes 7c-e bearing electron-donating (-CH3) or electron-withdrawing (-F and -OCF3) groups at the C-5 position of the benzene ring were all competent in the reaction to deliver the corresponding products 8c-e with modest results (57-63% yield and 67:33-83:17 rr). Equally impressively, this coupling process also tolerated difluorinated salicylaldehyde 7f, as observed in the assembly of 8f. Inspired by a previous work on the formation of a C(sp2)-Se bond,36 we initiated studies on the CuO nanoparticles (CuO NPs) catalyzed coupling reaction of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid and dibenzyl diselenides. Having established the optimized reaction conditions wherein hydroquinine-selenide 10a was obtained with a 60% yield and 45:55 rr (see SI for details), we went on to assess the generality of the coupling reaction pertaining to an armory of dialkyl diselenides (Table 5). All the reactions proceeded smoothly to install alkylselenyl groups (9b-o) onto the C-6′ position, affording a variety of hydroquinine-selenides 10b-o with 43-72% yields and 50:50-63:37 rr within 12 h. Diselenides with electron-donating substituents including methyl (9b), tert-butyl (9c), and methoxy (9d) groups at the para-position of the benzene ring for the benzyl group could give rise to the products 10b-d. Among them, 10d was gained in a higher yield of 72%, suggesting the strong electron-donating group (9d) is beneficial to the current reaction. The ortho-substitution (9e) was tolerated, as displayed by the formation of 10e. It was revealed that the diselenides equipped by disubstituted phenyl groups (9f and 9g) on the α-carbon were both suitable for the transformation (10f and 10g). The method was also compatible with fused aromatic substituents at the α-position, such as naphthalene-1-yl (9h) and naphthalene-2-yl (9i) groups. 1,2-Bis(cyclopentylmethyl)diselenide (9j) was con-verted to the desired product (10j) smoothly in moderate yield. Furthermore, the linear chain alkyl diselenides, including n-butyl (9k), and n-heptyl (9l) groups, were tested. The results showed that the length of the alkyl group could influence the yield of the product, with a longer chain leading to a lower yield (10k vs 10l). The substitution could be extended to the phenylethyl group (9m), and the target product (10m) was gained in 56% yield and with 50:50 rr. The effect of steric hindrance was not observed when diselenides bearing i-propyl (9n) and cyclohexyl (9o) groups were used as the substrates. Hydroquinine-selenides 10a-o newly synthesized might be potent catalysts for the cross-oxidative coupling reaction of nucleophiles and olefins according to the previous reports,37 which would give an entry to various allyl C-H functionalized compounds. In 2011, Deng and coauthors reported a hydroquinidine-derived catalyst 13 bearing a TIPS-ether38 (Scheme 1-1). When the TIPS group was installed on the hydroxyl group of hydroquinidine 11 at the C-9 position, the rotamers of intermediate 12 appeared (69:31 rr). Even if the adjacent methyl group was removed subsequently, the rotamers of 13 still existed (92:8 rr). These results indicated that the presence of the bulky TIPS group created a highly congested molecular space, thereby causing the occurrence of rotational isomerism. Similarly, the phenomenon was observed on the TIPS-protected hydroquinine 14 (75:25 rr), the demethylation product 15 (89:11 rr) (Scheme 1-2), and most of the coupling products. To further confirm the existence of rotamers, the representative coupling products 5a, 8a, and 10a were selected to remove the bulky TIPS group (Scheme 1-3). As expected, the corresponding derivatives 16, 17, and 18 were obtained without rotamers after the deprotection reaction. In addition, the stability of the rotamers of the coupling products was examined (Scheme 1-3). The rr values of the coupling products 5a and 8a remained unchanged after subjecting them to high temperature for 8 h, while the rr value of 10a only displayed a slight increase. These findings strongly suggested that these rotamers possess considerable energy barriers that prevent interconversion.  CONCLUSION In summary, arylboronic acids are essential substrates in organic chemistry, playing a central role in a wide range of coupling reactions. Taking this truth into account, we designed and synthesized hydroquinine-6′-boric acid via a palladium-catalyzed borylation/silica gel promoted hydrolysis sequence, which granted infinite possibilities on the functionalization of hydroquinine. To illustrate the possibilities, hydroquinine-6′-boric acid was involved in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, Petasis reaction, and selenylation reaction, respec-tively. All these reactions proceeded smoothly to access the corresponding valuable 6′-functionalized hydroquinines with satisfactory results. We believe that hydroquinine-6′-boric acid would be a promising versatile building block for drug discovery and catalytic chemistry. Further derivatizations of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid and evaluating the catalytic performance of hydroquinines with aminoarylmethine motifs and hydroquinine-selenides are underway in our laboratory.  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Information. 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz instrument (400 MHz for 1H NMR, 101 MHz for 13C NMR and 377 MHz for 19F NMR) with CDCl3 as a solvent. 1H NMR spectra were internally referenced to tetramethyl silane (δ 0). 13C NMR spectra were internally referenced to CDCl3 (δ 77.23).

        "A Palladium-Catalyzed Borylation/Silica Gel Promoted Hydrolysis Sequence for the Synthesis of Hydroquinine-6′-Boric Acid and Its Applications",
        "Wei Liang,§ Zheng-Jun Chen,§ Long-Hao Ran, and Lin Chen*ABSTRACT: Hydroquinine-6′-boric acid was first synthesized via a palladium-catalyzed borylation/silica gel promoted hydrolysis sequence of hydroquinine-derived triflate and bis(pinacolato)-diboron. The newly designed chiral building block was subjected to the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, Petasis reaction, and selenylation reaction, respectively, and all these reactions worked well to afford the corresponding 6′-functionalized hydroquinines with satisfactory results, demonstrating its extraordinary application potency.",
        "INTRODUCTION Arylboronic acids are highly active molecules that serve as the most essential building blocks in organic synthesis.1 In the past decades, arylboronic acids participated in several significant types of coupling reaction, such as Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction,2 Chan-Lam reaction,3 Liebeskind-Srogl reaction,4 Petasis reaction,5 P-arylation,6 and selenylation,7 leading to the construction of numerous valuable com-pounds�medicines, catalysts, natural products, and pesti-cides.8Cinchona alkaloids, extracted from the bark of Cinchona of f icinalis, represent the most well-known natural products with quinine as a prominent member.9 As early as the 17th century, cinchona alkaloids had been widely utilized for the treatment of malaria.10 Additionally, they were recognized to exhibit a diverse spectrum of bioactivities like antineoplastic,11 antimicrobial,12 anti-inflammatory,13 and analgesic14 behaviors. On the other hand, a myriad of chiral organocatalysts have been created to facilitate the asymmetric synthesis of truly precious, optically pure molecules over the course of the past two decades, with cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives standing out as the most important members amidst them.15 Currently, the structural transformations of cinchona alkaloids primarily include three aspects (Figure 1): (i) quinuclidine isomerization,16 terminal olefin conversion,17 and quaterniza-tion;18 (ii) conversions of secondary hydroxyl group at C-9 position comprising halogenation,19 arylation,20 amination,21 hydroxyl protection,22 and oxidation;23 and (iii) structural modification of the quinoline-ring system at C-2′, 5′, 6′, 7′, and 8′ positions.24 It is noteworthy that the functionalization of the C-6′ position is crucial, as the group at this position often interacts with the quinuclidine moiety, greatly affecting the biological activity or catalytic performance of cinchona alkaloids. Several studies focused on quinine or its derivatives to realize alkylation,25 amination,26 fluorination,27 sulfona-tion,28 and etherification29 at the C-6′ position for catalytic or pharmaceutical applications, predominantly due to the presence of convenient handles and the relatively lower cost compared to other cinchona alkaloids. Despite the seminal functionalization presented, it is still necessary to further adorn quinine and its derivatives at their C-6′ position, thus accessing molecular diversity to meet the exuberant demand from drug discovery and asymmetric catalysis.",
        "In this work, hydroquinine-6′-boric acid was first synthesized via a palladium-catalyzed borylation/silica gel promoted hydrolysis sequence of hydroquinine-derived triflate30 and bis(pinacolato)diboron. The successful introduction of the boric acid group to the C-6′ position of the quinoline ring bestowed infinite possibilities on the functionalization of hydroquinine. To demonstrate its application potency, hydro-quinine-6′-boric acid was involved in a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling with aryl bromides, achieving the decoration of hydroquinine effectively. Multicomponent reactions were widely used as complexity-generating tactics to rapidly© XXXX American Chemical Societyhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.3c00774 J. Org. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXXfabricate diverse frameworks of interests in synthetic and biological fields.31 A catalyst-free Petasis reaction of hydro-quinine-6′-boric acid, piperidine, and salicylaldehyde was then investigated, which afforded a set of hydroquinines equipped with aminoarylmethine motifs. Organoselenium compounds are a pivotal class of entities owing to their multitudinous applications in the realm of catalysis, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.32 Accordingly, we explored a CuO nano-particles catalyzed coupling reaction of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid and dialkyl diselenides, and this reaction granted a series of distinctive hydroquinine-selenides.",
        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initially, the palladium-catalyzed borylation reaction of hydro-quinine-derived triflate 1 and bis(pinacolato)diboron 2 was conducted in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 with triphenylphos-phine (PPh3) as a ligand and Cs2CO3 as a base in 1,4-dioxane (moisture content = 0.15%) under argon ambient, but no reaction was observed after being stirred at 80 °C for 8 h (Table 1, entry 1). The same result was obtained when the inorganic base was replaced with NaOAc (entry 2). Fortunately, the reaction occurred smoothly to generate a new compound in 4 h, employing KOAc as the base (entry 3). However, the polarity of the compound was much larger than that of 1, making us doubt whether the compound was hydroquinine-6′-borate. The structural characterization deter-mined that the compound gained was hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 (30% yield). PdCl2 exhibited lower catalytic activity, and only a 21% yield of product was obtained after 7 h (entry 4). Another ligand led to a worse result, as shown by the application of 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) (entry 5). The catalytic activity of NiCl2 combined with 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) was tested, but it could not drive the reaction (entry 6). The solvents were screened, including toluene, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and acetonitrile (entries 7-9). The use of acetonitrile (moisture content = 0.04%) as the solvent not only shortened the reaction time but also greatly increased the yield of product(entry 9). Subsequently, we estimated the effect of the loading amount of catalyst and ligand on the reaction. It was found that 3 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 together with 12 mol % of PPh3 could still promote the reaction, affording the product in a slightly higher yield albeit with a prolonged reaction time (entry 10 vs entry 9). However, the catalytic efficiency dropped sharply using 1 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 (entry 11). Reducing the amount of inorganic base was also detrimental to the reaction (entry 12). Finally, we checked the impact of the stoichiometry of the substrates on the reaction. Decreasing the amount of bis(pinacolato)diboron 2 resulted in slight erosion of the yield (entries 13 and 14 vs entry 10). To show the synthetic potential of this protocol, a preparative-scale synthesis of 3 was executed. Up to 10.0 mmol of 1 reacted with 2 smoothly under the optimized reaction conditions to provide the desired product 3 in maintained yield (entry 15). A single cuboidcrystal of triflate monohydrate of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 was obtained by recrystallization from a petroleum ether/ethyl acetate system, and the absolute configuration of 3 was established by X-ray crystallographic analysis (CCDC number: 2141376).33To probe the reaction mechanism, a borylation reaction which experienced anhydrous, moist, and silica gel-containing stages sequentially was monitored by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (see SI for details). The spectra of HRMS implied that (i) the hydroquinine-6′-borate hardly underwent in situ hydrolysis in the borylation process, even if there was a high moisture content in the reaction system; and (ii) silica gel was able to promote the hydrolysis of hydroquinine-6′-borate to generate hydroquinine-6′-boric acid. The results of the subsequent controlled experiments (Table 2) further substantiated the hydrolysis of hydroquinine-6′-borate during the purification process through column chromatography on silica gel. Another vital piece of evidence was that hydroquinine-6′-borate was not observed at all on the silica gel plate when monitoring the reaction by thin-layer chromatography. Thus, it was a palladium-catalyzed boryla-tion/silica gel promoted hydrolysis sequence that realized the construction of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid.",
        "With hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 in hand, we first examined the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of 3 with 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene 4a under the conditions we established previously (Table 3).34 The reaction proceeded smoothly to produce the desired product 5a as a mixture of rotamers with a 62% yield and a 67:33 rotameric ratio (rr) within 4 h. Without further optimization of reaction conditions, we sought to assess the scope and generality of the reaction with respect to multifarious aryl bromides. Polyaromatic bromine (4b) was tolerated to forge 5b with an acceptable yield and rr value. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles as the basic scaffolds are present in more than half of all marketed drugs.35 Thus, heteroaryl bromides with pyridine-2-yl (4c), pyridine-3-yl (4d), quinoline-4-yl (4e), and indole-5-yl (4f) groups were evaluated. Substrates 4c and 4d appeared to be a little sluggish, taking more time to deliver the coupling products 5c and 5d in moderate yields. Note that the rotamers of 5c and 5d were not observed. Importantly, quinoline-4-yl (4e) and indole-5-yl (4f) groups could be introduced to the C-6′ position of hydroquinine with satisfactory results (5e and 5f). 5-Bromo isatin 4g was an appropriate substrate to furnish the target product 5g in 40% yield without a rotamer. Attempts to expand this catalytic chemistry to the oxygen-containing heteroaromatic bromides, such as 6-bromo-4H-chromen-4-one 4h and 3-bromodibenzo[b,d]furan 4i, were also successful.",
        "Afterward, hydroquinine-6′-boric acid 3 was subjected to the Petasis reaction with piperidine 6 and salicylaldehyde 7a as the partners. Without the catalyst, the reaction could proceed at 100 °C to unveil the coupling product 8a with a 54% yield and 71:29 rr (Table 4). We then examined the scope of the reaction regarding a range of salicylaldehydes under the original conditions. This reaction was compatible with 4-methoxy substitution (7b), resulting in the generation of desired product 8b with a 45% yield and 77:23 rr. The salicylaldehydes 7c-e bearing electron-donating (-CH3) or electron-withdrawing (-F and -OCF3) groups at the C-5 position of the benzene ring were all competent in the reaction to deliver the corresponding products 8c-e with modest results (57-63% yield and 67:33-83:17 rr). Equally impressively, this coupling process also tolerated difluorinated salicylaldehyde 7f, as observed in the assembly of 8f.",
        "Inspired by a previous work on the formation of a C(sp2)-Se bond,36 we initiated studies on the CuO nanoparticles (CuO NPs) catalyzed coupling reaction of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid and dibenzyl diselenides. Having established the optimized reaction conditions wherein hydroquinine-selenide10a was obtained with a 60% yield and 45:55 rr (see SI for details), we went on to assess the generality of the coupling reaction pertaining to an armory of dialkyl diselenides (Table 5). All the reactions proceeded smoothly to install alkylselenyl groups (9b-o) onto the C-6′ position, affording a variety of hydroquinine-selenides 10b-o with 43-72% yields and 50:50-63:37 rr within 12 h. Diselenides with electron-donating substituents including methyl (9b), tert-butyl (9c), and methoxy (9d) groups at the para-position of the benzene ring for the benzyl group could give rise to the products 10b-d. Among them, 10d was gained in a higher yield of 72%, suggesting the strong electron-donating group (9d) is beneficial to the current reaction. The ortho-substitution (9e) was tolerated, as displayed by the formation of 10e. It was revealed that the diselenides equipped by disubstituted phenyl groups (9f and 9g) on the α-carbon were both suitable for the transformation (10f and 10g). The method was also compatible with fused aromatic substituents at the α-position, such as naphthalene-1-yl (9h) and naphthalene-2-yl (9i) groups. 1,2-Bis(cyclopentylmethyl)diselenide (9j) was con-verted to the desired product (10j) smoothly in moderate yield. Furthermore, the linear chain alkyl diselenides, including n-butyl (9k), and n-heptyl (9l) groups, were tested. The results showed that the length of the alkyl group could influence the yield of the product, with a longer chain leading to a lower yield (10k vs 10l). The substitution could be extended to the phenylethyl group (9m), and the target product (10m) was gained in 56% yield and with 50:50 rr. The effect of steric hindrance was not observed when diselenides bearing i-propyl (9n) and cyclohexyl (9o) groups were used as the substrates. Hydroquinine-selenides 10a-o newly synthesized might be potent catalysts for the cross-oxidative coupling reaction of nucleophiles and olefins according to the previous reports,37 which would give an entry to various allyl C-H functionalized compounds.",
        "In 2011, Deng and coauthors reported a hydroquinidine-derived catalyst 13 bearing a TIPS-ether38 (Scheme 1-1). When the TIPS group was installed on the hydroxyl group of hydroquinidine 11 at the C-9 position, the rotamers of intermediate 12 appeared (69:31 rr). Even if the adjacent methyl group was removed subsequently, the rotamers of 13 still existed (92:8 rr). These results indicated that the presence of the bulky TIPS group created a highly congested molecular space, thereby causing the occurrence of rotational isomerism. Similarly, the phenomenon was observed on the TIPS-protected hydroquinine 14 (75:25 rr), the demethylationproduct 15 (89:11 rr) (Scheme 1-2), and most of the coupling products. To further confirm the existence of rotamers, the representative coupling products 5a, 8a, and 10a were selected to remove the bulky TIPS group (Scheme 1-3). As expected, the corresponding derivatives 16, 17, and 18 were obtained without rotamers after the deprotection reaction. In addition, the stability of the rotamers of the coupling products was examined (Scheme 1-3). The rr values of the coupling products 5a and 8a remained unchanged after subjecting them to high temperature for 8 h, while the rr value of 10a only displayed a slight increase. These findings strongly suggested that these rotamers possess considerable energy barriers that prevent interconversion.",
        "CONCLUSION In summary, arylboronic acids are essential substrates in organic chemistry, playing a central role in a wide range of coupling reactions. Taking this truth into account, we designed and synthesized hydroquinine-6′-boric acid via a palladium-catalyzed borylation/silica gel promoted hydrolysis sequence, which granted infinite possibilities on the functionalization of hydroquinine. To illustrate the possibilities, hydroquinine-6′-boric acid was involved in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, Petasis reaction, and selenylation reaction, respec-tively. All these reactions proceeded smoothly to access the corresponding valuable 6′-functionalized hydroquinines with satisfactory results. We believe that hydroquinine-6′-boric acid would be a promising versatile building block for drug discovery and catalytic chemistry. Further derivatizations of hydroquinine-6′-boric acid and evaluating the catalytic performance of hydroquinines with aminoarylmethine motifs and hydroquinine-selenides are underway in our laboratory.",
