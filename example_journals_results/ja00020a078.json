Cyclopropylcarbene-Tungsten Complexes + Alkynes: A [4 + 2+1] Cycloaddition Route for the Construction of Seven-Membered Rings James W. Herndon,* Gautam Chatterjee, Paren P. Patel, Julius J. Matasi, Seniz U. Turner, Jill J. Harp, and Margaret D. Reid Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742 Received May 23, 1991 Carbocyclic seven-membered rings are present in a variety of medicinally important compounds and are typically constructed by ring expansion reactions, cyclization reactions, reactions of other seven-membered rings, and occasionally cycloaddition reactions. Cycloaddition reactions have the greatest potential, but few leading to direct formation of a seven-membered ring have been reported.1 To develop a seven membered ring forming cycloaddition reaction, the reaction between cyclopropylcarbene-chromium complexes and alkynes was examined (Scheme I). This reaction produced (1) Some examples of seven-membered ring-forming cycloaddition reac-tions include the following: (a) Davies,  .M. L; McAfee, M. J.; Oldenburg, C. E. M. J. Org.

At 100 °C in dioxane, cy-cloheptadienone derivative 5 was produced in 21% yield along with a trace of rearranged cycloheptadienone 6 (Scheme II). Longer reflux times led to formation of greater amounts of cyclo-heptadienone 6 at the expense of 5. Cycloheptadienone 5 was converted to 6 after 2 h at 140 °C; the mechanism presumably involves consecutive 1,5-hydride shifts.4 In contrast to previous results obtained with alkylcarbene-tungsten complexes and alk-ynes,5 the cycloaddition reaction was never complete at 100 eC. Optimal yields of cycloheptadienone 6 (55%) were obtained when the reaction was conducted in refluxing xylene (140 °C) in the presence of l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene.

Soc. 1991, 113, 7809-7810 7809 Scheme V yields were generally higher when triarylphosphines were present in the reaction, but the reaction was severely retarded by more nucleophilic phosphines like (diphenylphosphino)ethane and tributylphosphine. Triphenylphosphine-substituted complex 11 was considerably less reactive than pentacarbonyl complex 4,6 suggesting that phosphines assist with some later stage of the reaction, but are detrimental if initial CO-ligand replacement occurs. Contrary to our predictions, complexes 7-10 were as unreactive as the parent carbene complex 4 in reactions with diphenylacetylene.7 W(CO)5 |WW(C0)5 ^(COWPPha) ^~^0(CH2)nSCH3 0(CH2)nCH-CH2 OCH3 7 n-2 9 =2 11 8 n-3 10 n = 3 carbon in intermediate metallacycle 21 (path a). The reaction is obviously driven by steric effects since the activating effect of a phenyl ring should have driven the reaction toward pathway b.13 In summary, we have discovered a new cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of seven-membered rings. The reaction shows regioselectivity both in the alkyne addition steps and in the cy-clopropane ring opening steps and is a potentially powerful syn-thetic method. Further investigations in the areas of yield op-timization and delineation of the differences in behavior of different cyclopropane-substituted metal-carbene complexes are ongoing. Acknowledgment. This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (GM-40777) and the donors of the Petroleum Research Fund, administered by the American Chemical Society (23332-AC1). The reaction proceeded similarly with 4-octyne or 1-phenyl-propyne at 140 °C to produce isomerized cycloheptadienone derivatives (12 + 13) in 61% (12A:13A = 85:15) and 45% (only 12B) yields, respectively (Scheme III). With 1-phenylpropyne, only the indicated regioisomer was obtained.5·8 In these two cases, substantial amounts of furanones (14) were obtained when a phosphine additive was omitted.9 Terminal alkynes did not provide cycloheptadienone derivatives. Upon thermolysis, alk-yne-carbene complex 15 produced cycloheptadienone derivative 17 in 63% yield (Scheme IV). Cycloheptadienone 17 is pre-sumably the thermodynamically more stable compound, perhaps due to an anomeric effect.10 At long reflux times (>20 h), hydrogenated compound 18 was a significant impurity. Carbene complexes containing unsymmetrical cyclopropane rings can lead to two possible cycloaddition products (Scheme V). Reaction of diphenylacetylene with complex 19A led to only cycloheptadienone 23A in 30% yield; with (phenylcyclopropyl)-carbene complex 19B, cycloheptadienone 25 was produced in 53% yield. The observed regiochemistry reflects a preference for breaking the less-substituted carbon-carbon bond of the cyclo-propane ring in the ring-opening step,24,11 eventually giving the compound wherein tungsten is bonded to the less-substituted (6) For fl/lty/carbene-chromium complexes, the triphenylphosphine-sub-stituted complexes are more reactive.

Soc. 1990,112, 8615-8617. An alternative mechanistic pathway has been suggested by a reviewer: the reaction produces (cyclopropylvinyl)ketene intermediate, which undergoes electrocyclic ring closure to generate a cycloheptadienone. This mechanism is probably not operative since 4-cyclopropyl-4-methoxy-2,3-diphenyl-2-cyclobutenone and 4-cyclopropyl-4-hydroxy-2,3-diisopropoxy-2-cyclobutenone both fail to produce seven-membered rings upon thermolysis.12 Metal-complexed vinylketenes, however, cannot be ruled out as intermediates.

An alternative mechanistic pathway has been suggested by a reviewer: the reaction produces (cyclopropylvinyl)ketene intermediate, which undergoes electrocyclic ring closure to generate a cycloheptadienone. This mechanism is probably not operative since 4-cyclopropyl-4-methoxy-2,3-diphenyl-2-cyclobutenone and 4-cyclopropyl-4-hydroxy-2,3-diisopropoxy-2-cyclobutenone both fail to produce seven-membered rings upon thermolysis.12 Metal-complexed vinylketenes, however, cannot be ruled out as intermediates.",

        "Catalytic Disproportionation of Hydrogen Peroxide by [MnIV(M2-0)(SALPN)]2 Erlund J. Larson and Vincent L. Pecoraro*Willard H. Dow Laboratories, Department of ChemistryFunctional modeling of the reactions performed by the man-ganese catalase and the oxygen evolving complex are scarce al-though two systems which catalytically convert hydrogen peroxide to dioxygen and water have been described. The first1 employs a dimanganese Schiff base complex which cycles between Mnn2 and Mn,n2 while the second2 3uses a Mn(III) porphyrin dimer that may achieve the Mn(IV) or Mn(V) oxidation level during cata-lysis. Although groundbreaking in their ability to catalyze this important reaction, neither system contains the biologically pre-cedented (µ2-02')2 core. Previously, models having this structural unit have not exhibited catalase activity.' We have described4 the quantitative formation of [MnIV(SALPN)(M2-0)]2 (1) by the reaction of [bis(salicylideneaminato)propane] [acetonyl-acetonate]manganese(III), (Mnm(SALPN)(AcAc)) with hy-(1) Mathur, P.; Crowder, M.; Dismukes, G.
