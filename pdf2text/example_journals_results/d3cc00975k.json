The reaction has wider substrate scope with simple starting materials, and the desired tetrasubstituted furans were prepared in good to excellent yields. Polyfunctionalized furans constitute an important class of five-membered O-heterocycles with widespread applications.1 Furans are extremely important heterocyclic compounds (Fig. 1)2–5 and worthy of attention as they exhibit a wide range of biological activities.6,7 Transition metal-catalyzed cyclization reactions, espe-cially intermolecular cyclizations of structurally simple starting materials, are among the most direct and practical methods for the construction of substituted furans.8 Ma and co-workers reported a method for the synthesis of 3-alkynyl polysubstituted furans by gold-catalyzed C(sp3)–H/C(sp2)–H coupling/cyclization/oxi-dative alkynylation sequentially.9 Cao and co-workers synthesized a-carbonyl furan derivatives by Pd-catalyzed cyclization reaction between benzoylacetates and propargyl vinyl ethers.10 Wang and co-workers developed a method for the synthesis of sulfonyl-substituted furans via copper-mediated annulation between acet-ylenic sulfones and activated methylenes.11 Cui and co-workers described the cobalt-catalyzed synthesis of substituted furans from alkynes and a-diazocarbonyls.12 The Wang group has reported a novel method for the synthesis of polysubstituted furans via sequential Rh-catalyzed arylation and cycloisomerization of cyclopropane.13 Recently, a Rh(III)-catalyzed cyclization of acrylic acids with a-diazocarbonyls led to the synthesis of furans.14 Inspired by these reactions, we envisaged a novel strategy for the synthesis of polysubstituted furans via annulation reaction of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoates and diphenylacetylenes using Rh-catalyzed reaction conditions. Unlike previously reported methods (Scheme 1(a) and (b))15,16 our work on the catalytic C(sp3)–H bond functionalization of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate with diphenyl-acetylene via oxidative annulation reaction resulted in the synth-esis of tetra-substituted furans (Scheme 1(c)). Initially, we started an annulation reaction between ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1a and diphenylacetylene 2a, which were selected as a model substrate for screening of the reaction condi-tions for the synthesis of substituted furans. When we examined the reaction between 1a and 2a in the presence of catalysts such as Pd(OAc)2, PtBr2, and RuO2, at 5 mol% loading, Cu(OAc)2NoneH2O (1.0 equiv.) as an oxidant, AgSbF6 as an additive and K2CO3 (2.0 equiv.) as a base in dichloroethane at 120 1C for 6 h did not afford the desired product 3aa (Table 1, entries 1–3). Then, we tried a reaction with RuCl2(PPh3)3 as a catalyst for the annulation reaction of 1a and 2a using similar reaction conditions and as a result traces of product formation were observed (Table 1, entry 4). When we used [RuCl2(pcymene)]2 as a catalyst in place of RuCl2(PPh3)3 and carried out a reaction between 1a and 2a, it fortunately afforded the Chem. Commun.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023desired product 3aa in 67% yield (Table 1, entry 5). A few more experiments were performed in the absence of catalyst, oxidant, additive and base to explore their roles in the reaction (Table 1, entries 6–9). We next screened a few oxidants such as Cu(OTf)2 and AgOAc which yielded 47% and 32% of the desired product, respectively (Table 1, entries 10–11); hence, we concluded that the oxidant Cu(OAc)2NoneH2O may provide the best yield (Table 1, entry 5). Similarly, we examined another additive i.e., AgBF4, which also did not increase the yield (Table 1, entry 12). The role of other bases such as Na2CO3 and Cs2CO3 (Table 1, entries 13–14) and different solvents was also screened and there was no improvement in the yield of the reaction (Table 1, entries 15–19). With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we tested the substrate scope between various substituted/un-substituted ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoates 1a–1k and diaryl-acetylenes 2a–2g to synthesize tetra-substituted furans 3aa–3kd, 3ag, 3gg and 3hg with the yields ranging from 59 to 81% (Scheme 2). When, we examined the compatibility of unsub-stituted ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1a with unsubstituted/sub-stituted diaryl-acetylenes 2a, 2c and 2d afforded the desired products 3aa, 3ac, and 3ad in good yields with 63–74% (Scheme 2). Furthermore, we explored the substrate scope between electron releasing groups on the ortho, and meta-position of sub-stituted ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoates 1b–1d reacted with sub-stituted/unsubstituted diarylalkynes 2a, 2c and 2e to give products 3ba, 3ca, 3da, 3dc and 3de in better yields than an electron with-drawing group (F) on the ortho-position of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1c (Scheme 2). Electron releasing groups (OMe, Me, and C–(CH3)3) on the para-position of diphenyl alkyne produced the desired product in slightly better yields than electron with-drawing groups (F, Cl and Br) on the para-position of diphenyl alkyne (Scheme 2). Electron releasing groups on the para-position of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1e–1f reacted with 2a–2c providing the products 3ea, 3eb, 3ec and 3fa with good yields (Scheme 2). When we screened the electron withdrawing groups (F, Cl and Br) on the para-position of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1g–1i with unsubstituted/substituted diaryl alkyne 2a, 2c and 2f it gave 3ga, 3gc, 3gf, 3ha, 3hc, 3hd and 3ia in good to moderate yields (Scheme 2). Furthermore, we focused on electron-releasing groups containing disubstituted ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1j, which was reacted with 2a, 2b, 2d and 2f to obtain products 3ja, 3jb, 3jd, and 3jf in good yields (Scheme 2). A reaction of the 3,4,5-OMe group containing ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1k with substituted/ unsubstituted diaryl alkynes 2a, 2b and 2d resulted in the products 3ka, 3kb and 3kd in better yields (Scheme 2). We also explored the substrate scope for the reaction between ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1a, 1g and 1h with 2g to afford the products 3ag, 3gg, and 3hg in 70%, 63% and 65% yields, respectively. When we examined the substrate scope between substituted ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1g and 1k and unsymmetrical substituted diary-lalkyne 2h and 2i under the optimized reaction conditions, it produced a mixture of compounds 3gh (65 : 35), 3kh (60 : 40), and 3ki (63 : 37) (Scheme 2). This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Commun.We also tested a reaction with internal alkyne 2j bearing both aliphatic and aromatic substituents and heteroaryl alkyne 2k with ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoates/3,4,5-trimethoxy substi-tuted ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1a/1k and obtained the respective tetrasubstituted furans 3aj (86 : 14 mixture)/3kj (90 : 10 mixture) and 3kk. A reaction with an aliphatic ester 1l and methyl 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-oxopropanoate 1m with diaryl alkyne 2a using the optimized conditions also gave the desired tetrasubstituted furan; however, the yields were low in all these reactions (3aj: 47%; 3kj: 57%; 3kk: 56%; 3la: 58%; 3ma: 58%) (Scheme 3). Furthermore, we attempted a few more reactions between ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1a and phenylacetylene 2l (terminal alkyne) and aliphatic internal alkyne 2m and 1,3-diphenylpropane-Chem. Commun.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20231,3-dione 1n and pentane-2,4-dione 1o, heterocyclic propanoates such as ethyl 3-oxo-3-(thiophen-3-yl)propanoate 1p, ethyl 3-oxo-3-(thiophen-2-yl)propanoate 1q, and ethyl 3-(furan-2-yl)-3-oxopro-panoate 1r with 1,2-diphenylethyne 2a, which failed to produce the desired product 3ak/3al, 3ma/3na and 3pa/3qa/3ra under the standard reaction conditions (Scheme 4). Liu and co-workers could synthesize polysubstituted furans by oxidative cyclization of diethylbut-2-yne dioate with 1a, 1n and 1o in the presence of Ag(I)/ SnCl2–CuI, which indicates the necessity of electron withdrawing groups on alkynes to react with diketoester 1a aliphatic and aromatic diketones 1n and 1o to produce polysubstituted furans.8j,l In the case of furan 3pa and 3qa synthesis from hetero-cyclic propanoates 1p–1r, the carbonyl might have strongly stabi-lized to restrict the formation of the enol tautomer. A possible reaction mechanism for polysubstituted furan synthesis appears to be oxidative annulation of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 1a with diaryl alkyne 2a (Scheme 5). Initially, the base can promote the reaction of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpro-panoate 1a with the Ru(II)-catalyst to generate intermediate-1 (Int-1). Subsequent coordinative insertion of diarylalkyne 2a gives alkenyl Ru(II) intermediate-2 (Int-2), which would undergo intramolecular C–H activation to form cyclic intermediate-3 (Int-3) with the aid of the base. Then, a reductive elimination of Int-3 gives substituted furan 3aa and regenerates the catalyst for the next catalytic cycle. Our control experiments (Table 1; entries 1–4 and 6–9 and ESI†) also support the proposed reaction mechanism. Further studies, however, are required to confirm the exact reaction mechanism. To demonstrate the practicality of the reaction, we prepared 3ka in larger quantities and transformed it to acid 4 and alcohol 5, and subsequently amide 5 and aldehyde 7, respectively (Scheme 6). In summary, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of polysubstituted furans by Ru(II)-catalyzed oxidative annulation reaction between ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoates/ ethyl 3-oxobutanoate and diaryl alkynes/diheteroaryl/prop-1-yn-1-ylbenzene for the first time in the presence of Cu(OAc)2NoneH2O and additive AgSbF6 and demonstrated its broader substrate scope. In addition, the synthetic practicality of this protocol has been demonstrated by the construction of diverse useful func-tionalized furan derivatives. Moreover, simple and readily available reagents and starting materials are additional advan-tages of this strategy.
