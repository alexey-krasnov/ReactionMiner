Rev., 2023,52, 4632Frustrated Lewis pair chemistry of CO Douglas W. Stephan ab Transition metal species readily capture and react with CO as the metal can act both as an acceptor and donor of electron density. In contrast, such a situation is less common in the main group and thus far fewer examples of main group CO adducts and their subsequent reactivity have been studied. In this review, we focus on the application of the concept of Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) to develop main group chemistry of CO. Specifically, we address reactions of FLPs that illustrate the ability to capture CO in addition to subsequent reactivity involving reduction with a variety of reagents. These developments illustrate that the donation and acceptance of electron density provided by FLPs is an alternative strategy to advance the reactivity of CO. Such insights augur well for future advances in the homogeneous chemistry of CO. 1. Introduction Carbon monoxide (CO) is a common ligand in organometallic complexes. As a quintessential example of a ‘‘non-classic’’ ligand, it interacts with a metal centre via s-donation and acts as a p-acceptor by accepting metal d-orbital electron density into its p*-orbitals. This back-donation from the metal strengthens the metal–carbon bond accounting for the ability of metal to form carbonyl derivatives. In contrast, the interactions of CO with boron derivatives are much less common as these Lewis acidic species can accept donation from CO, but do not have low lying d-electrons avail-able for back donation. Consequently, it is only derivatives that offer very high Lewis acidity that are capable of forming isolable CO adducts. For example, as early as 1937, the species H3B(CO) was described (Fig. 1).1 In 2002, the species (F3C)3B(CO) was prepared and crystallographically characterized (Fig. 1).2 Subse-quently, in 2014 Erker and co-workers showed that Piers’ borane [HB(C6F5)2] forms an adduct with CO (Fig. 1). 3 More recently, the This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 | 4633Erker group reported the use of a highly Lewis acidic cation to capture CO, affording the adduct [(IMes)BH(C6F5)(CO)] + (Fig. 1).4 Another more recent strategy has been to employ reduced B-species. Several such borylene species have been shown to capture CO (Fig. 1).5–7 Concurrent with these efforts, the field of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry has emerged.8–14 This concept exploits combina-tions of donor and acceptor molecules to affect the activation of small molecules. While the initial findings were focused on dihydrogen activation15,16 and inferred that steric inhibition of adduct formation was essential, these views have also evolved. Indeed, FLP chemistry has been applied to the activation of wide range of small molecules including alkynes, olefins, CO2, N2O, SO2, SO, cyclopropanes, among others finding applications in organic synthesis, polymer chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.8–14 Moreover, explorations of the nature of FLPs have broadened our understanding regarding both the mode of action and the range of Lewis acids and bases that can act as FLPs. The long history of transition metals binding and activation of CO by acting as both an electron acceptor and donor, prompted questions about similar activation by the combined action of Lewis acids and bases. This notion together with the demonstrated ability of FLPs to effect catalytic metal-free hydrogenation, further prompted speculation of the possibility of transition metal-free mimics of classical Fischer–Tropsch chemistry. In this review, we discuss the recent developments in the FLP chemistry of CO. We begin by first describing conventional B/P FLP systems that capture CO (Section 2). This is followed by a discussion of stoichiometric reduction reactivity of CO with p-block FLPs (Section 3) and transition metal-based FLPs (Section 4). Stoichiometric reactivity of alkali metal-based FLPs providing syn-thetic routes to isocyanides and the homologation and reduction of CO are discussed (Section 5). The use of heterogeneous FLP systems in catalytic CO reduction is also presented (Section 6). We conclude with a discussion of the general lessons and a consideration of the future prospects for further development. 2. CO capture The concept of using FLPs to capture CO is predicated on the notion that the donor and acceptor requirements, typically seen for CO binding to a transition metal do not need to reside on a single atom, but rather can be provided by separated donor and acceptor molecules. In this fashion, the potential for reduction chemistry of CO can be further expanded employing main group species. The demonstration of the ability of FLPs to capture CO was first described in 2010 for the boron-amidinate, HC(iPrN)2-B(C6F5)2 1 (Scheme 1). 17 Although the ring-opened amidinate (i.e. the FLP) was not spectroscopically observed, it is believed that transient separation of a donor nitrogen of the amidinate and the acceptor boron atom act in concert to capture CO to give HC(iPrN)2(CO)B(C6F5)2 2 (Scheme 1). A much more recent paper18 has reported a related system based on the ferrocene linked bis-boron amidinate (tBuNQCHN(9-BBN)C5H4)2Fe. This species was shown to concurrently capture two molecules of CO while the related (tBuNCHN(B(C6F5)2)C5H4)2Fe 3 was able to capture CO2 and CO simultaneously to generate(tBuNCHNC-(O)(B(C6F5)2) C5H4)(tBuNCHNCO2(B(C6F5)2)C5H4)Fe 4 (Scheme 1). In a related fashion in 2017,19 the Erker group described the reaction of the B/N zwitterion C5H6Me4NQCHC(Me)HB(H)(C6F5)2 5 with CO in the presences of HB(C6F5)2 or B(C6F5)3. Interestingly, in these cases CO-insertion into the B–H bond and C–O coupling affords products of the form C5H6Me4NQCHC(Me)C(B(C6F5)2) (H)OC(O)(B(C6F5)2R) (R = H 6, C6F5 7) (Scheme 1). More recently, a 2021 report from Krempner and coworkers20 described the remarkable reaction of the B/N FLP C6H4(9-BBN)(NQC(NMe2)2) 8 with CO. While at room tempera-ture this species captures CO to give 9, at 120 1C the B and CO fragment swap places affording C6H4C(O)(9-BBN)(NQC(NMe2)2) 10 (Scheme 2). In contrast, in the presence of Me3SiO3SCF3 a further rearrangement occurs to give C6H4B(OSiMe3)(CC8H14) (NQC(NMe2)2) 11. Similarly in the presence of Al(C6F5)3, 4634 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023C6H4B(OAl(C6F5)3)(CC8H14)(NQC(NMe2)2) 12 was obtained. In a related fashion the species 9 also reacts with electrophiles to induce B/C rearrangement, affording C6H4(CC8H14)BO(E(C6F5)3) (NQC(NMe2)2) (E = Al 13, B 14) (Scheme 2). Also in 2021, Aldridge and coworkers21 described the interaction of the NB2 species, (Ar2BC6H2Me)2(CMe2)NMe (Ar = C6H2(CF3)3 15, C6F5 16) with CO. At room temperature, these species captured CO to give 17/18, respectively. Reversible arene migrations from B to the carbonyl carbon generated 19 and 20 (Scheme 3). On warming, C6F5Me is lost with the formation of CO bridge between the two B atoms with a B–N bond formation (Ar2BC6H2Me)(CMe2)NCO-BAr(C6H2Me) (Ar = C6F5 21) (Scheme 3). In the additional presence of PtBu3, the methyl bound to N is transferred to phosphorus affording the phosphonium salts [tBu3PMe] [(Ar2BC6H2Me)2 (CMe2)NCO] (Ar = C6H2(CF3)3 22, C6F5 23) (Scheme 3). In contrast, addition of DMAP (DMAP = Me2NC5H4N) afforded coordination of the pyridyl nitrogen to give a four-coordinate boron centre of 19, affording (DMAP)(ArBC6H2Me)(CMe2)NC(Ar)OBAr(C6H2Me) (Ar = C6H2(CF3)3 24). Most notably, the tuning of the boron substituents in 15 permitted the initially colourless species to capture CO in the temperature range of 40–70 1C with a dramatic colour change to red upon formation of 17 and 19. This provides a colorimetric test for gaseous CO. 2.1 Insights The early examples described above demonstrate the notion of CO capture by group 13/15 FLP combinations of Lewis acids and bases. In addition, Aldridge and coworkers21 have exploited such FLP capture of CO towards a sensor technology. While the concept of FLP based sensors is an intriguing one, the findings set the stage for the reactivity studies targeting chemistry of FLP sequestered CO. 3. p-Block FLPs and reactivity of CO Given the established ability of FLPs to capture CO, the next obvious questions are around the notions of reactivity and the potential for reduction. Of course, the wide variety of inter-and intramolecular FLPs that are accessible provide a broad chemical landscape to address this question. Below, the reac-tivity of a number of conventional main group FLP systems with CO are discussed. 3.1 Intermolecular P/B FLPs In a 2013 study,22 we explored the reactivity of the FLP tBu3P/ B(C6F5)3 with syn-gas (CO/H2). This afforded the salt [tBu3PH]-[(C6F5)3BC(H)OB(C6F5)3] 25 (Scheme 4). Warming this species induced the migration of C6F5 to the formyl-carbon atom, effecting the reduction of the CQO bond and affording the salt [tBu3PH]-[(C6F5)2BC(H)(C6F5)OB(C6F5)3] 26 (Scheme 4). This species reacted with H2 inducing the elimination of C6F5H, and the cleavage of the C–O bond affording the formation of salt of the anion [C6F5B-(CH2C6F5)OB(C6F5)3] None 27. On the other hand, 26 also reacted with additional CO effecting ring-expansion of the formyl-borane fragment affording the rare alkylcarboxylato-borate anion [(C6F5)2-BC(H)(C6F5)OCOB(C6F5)3] None 28 (Scheme 4). 3.2 Intramolecular P/B FLPs Concurrent with the above studies, examination of the use of P/B intramolecular FLPs in reactions with CO were undertaken by the Erker group. This work began with the report of the exposure of P/B FLP Mes2PC7H10B(C6F5)2 29 to CO (Scheme 5). In an argon matrix at 10 K, no reaction was observed. However, on warming to ca. 35 K the borane-CO adduct was observed as evidenced by the IR stretching frequency at 2196 cmNone1. This is somewhat higher in wavenumbers than that observed for free CO.23 Reactions of 29 with CO in solution afforded the FLP/CO addition product Mes2PC7H10B(C6F5)2(CO) 30 (Scheme 5), which was only stable below 240 K. In this species binding of B/P to CO affords a trigonal planar geometry at C, while the CO stretching frequency was 1791 cmNone1. In 30, as in the FLP adducts 2 and 4, the CO fragment acts both as a s-donor and a p-acceptor. However, in contrast to the Dewar–Chatt– This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 | 4635Duncanson model24,25 for the interactions of transition metals with CO, the acceptor and donor sites are disparate being on the B and P sites, respectively. In a subsequent effort, Erker et al.26 showed that the CO fragment in the FLP-CO adduct 29 was reduced via a net hydroboration in the presence of (C6F5)2BH yielding the epoxy-borate species, Mes2PC7H10B(C6F5)2(m-HCO)B(C6F5)2) 31 (Scheme 5). In a further study,27 the Erker group showed that treatment of 31 with pyridine generated the pyridine adduct of 29, 32 and the formyl-borane-pyridine adduct HC(O)B(C6F5)2(Py) 33. In this same report,27 the ‘‘Z2-formyl-borane’’ species 31 was reduced by H2 (60 bar) at 25 1C to yield C–O bond cleavage affording Mes2P(CH2)C7H10B(C6F5)2(m-OH)B(C6F5)2 34 (Scheme 5). The activation of H2 in this case is thought to result from the dissociation of the formyl-borane from the borane centre in 31. This generates a B/O FLP capable of heterolytic cleavage of H2 while subsequent hydride transfer from boron to carbon affords 34 (Scheme 5). In a related sense, borane/ether combinations were subsequently shown to be active for catalytic FLP hydrogenations of olefins.28 Analogous Z2-formyl-borane species were also obtained from the FLPs, Mes2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2 26 (3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)2-PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2 29 and Mes2PC5H8B(C6F5)2 26,30 affording the formyl borane-derivatives 35–37, respectively (Scheme 6). The analogous chemistry with a ‘‘semi-triptycene’’ back-bone FLP (C6H4CHCH2)2PMes2B(C6F5)2 38 in reaction with CO gave (C6H4CHCH2)2PMes2(CH2)B(C6F5)2(m-OH)B(C6F5)2 39 (Scheme 6).31 In contrast, the formyl borane adduct Mes2PCH2-CH2B(C6F5)2(m-HCO)B(C6F5)2 35 reacted with pyridine to gen-erate the borane-pyridine adduct (py)B(C6F5)2CH2CH2PMes2 (m-HCO)B(C6F5)2 40 (Scheme 6). In a further study, 32 35 reacted with NO to effect C–N coupling with loss of a hydrogen radical generating HNO and the product Mes2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2 (m-(O)CQNO)B(C6F5)2 41 (Scheme 6). In a related fashion 35 also reacted with SO2 effecting insertion into the formylborato-ring to give Mes2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2(m-HC(B(C6F5)2)OSO2) 42 (Scheme 6).33 This capture of SO2 was subsequently shown to be reversible.34 3.3 Secondary intramolecular P/B FLPs The Erker group explored the inclusion of secondary B fragments in FLPs. The species Mes2PCH2CH2B(H)(C6H2(CF3)3) 43 35 reacted with CO, undergoing insertion into the B–H bond afforded the borato-epoxide species Mes2PCH2CH2B(m-HC(O))(C6H2(CF3)3) 44 (Scheme 7). The analogous CO addition product Mes2PCHQ 4636 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023C(SiMe3)B(m-HC(O))(C6H2(CF3)3) 45 was also reported. 36 Species 44 was also shown to further react with HB(C6F5)2 to give Mes2PCH2CH2B(H)(m-HC(OB(C6F5)2)) (C6H2(CF3)3) 46 (Scheme 7). In a further subsequent study,37 compound 44 also reacted with CO2, isocyanate, and nitrile in the presence of B(C6F5)3 to effect C–C coupling reactions to give 47–49, respectively. Similarly, 44 in the presence of CO and B(C6F5)3 also effect C–C coupling to generate 50 which upon heating affords the enolate derivative 51 (Scheme 7). In a similar fashion, the FLP incorporating secondary phos-phine fragment was also probed.38 The reaction of the FLP (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6F5)2 52 (Scheme 8) with CO and HB(C6F5)2 gave (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6F5)(CH(B(C6F5)3)O) 53. Subsequent addition of this zwitterion with pyridine gave coordina-tion to boron and induced C6F5 transfer affording (tBu3C6H2)P(H)-CH2CH2B(C6F5)OCH(C6F5)B(C6F5)2(py) 54 (Scheme 8). The FLP incorporating both secondary phosphine and boranes, MesP(H)C(QCHtBu)B(C6H2(CF3)3)H 55 39 reacted with CO afford-ing the formaldehyde linkage between B and P in MesPC (QCHtBu)B(C6H2(CF3)3)(m-OCH2) 56. Treatment of 56 with N-phenyltriazolindione liberated formaldehyde and led to the for-mation of the cyclic FLP MesPC(QCHtBu)B(C6H2(CF3)3) (m-N2(C(O))2NPh) 57 (Scheme 9). In a subsequent 2020 paper, the Erker group40 described the reaction of the secondary PH/BH derived FLP (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)H 58 with CO, affording the formaldehyde-linked species (tBu3C6H2)P(H) CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)OCH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)CH2CH2P(H)(tBu3C6H2) 59 in which the CH2O fragment links two boron centres (Scheme 9). In contrast, reaction of 58 with B(C6F5)3 and CO gave (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)CHO2CB(C6F5)3 60, while sub-sequent reaction with pyridine forms a dative bond with B(C6F5)3 and prompted a rearrangement to give the phosphine-oxide in which a CH2 group links the P and B centres, (tBu3C6H2)-P(O)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)(CH2) 61. While this species was a dimer in the solid state, in solution it slowly converted to (tBu3C6H2)P-Me(O)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)OP(tBu3C6H2)CH2CH2B (C6H2(CF3)3(CH) 62 (Scheme 9). 3.4 Intramolecular PB2 FLPs In a 2015 study,41 the Erker group described the hydroboration of Mes2PCCH with Piers borane followed by the addition of proton and hydride which further underwent a second hydro-boration affording Mes2P(H)C(B(m-H)(C6F5)2)HCH2B(C6F5)2 63. Addition of a second equivalent of Piers borane afforded the FLP containing one phosphorus and two boron centres, Mes2P-(H)C(B(m-H)(C6F5)2)HCH2B(C6F5)2 63. This species reacted with CO at 80 1C, inducing insertion into the B–H bond and C6F5 migration to give Mes2P(H)CHCH(B(C6F5)3) OB(C6F5)(CH2) 64 (Scheme 10). In a closely related study,42 hydroboration of the phosphino-ene-yne Ph2PCRCC(Me)QCH2 and subsequent protonation, treatment with hydride and hydroboration afforded Ph2PCH2CH(Me)(CH(B(C6F5)2))2(m-H) 65. This species underwent a similar insertion of CO into the B–H bond, with C6F5 transfer yielding Ph2PCH2CH(Me) (CHB(C6F5)2)CHB-(C6F5)(m-OCH(C6F5)) 66 (Scheme 10). A further exploration43 of related reactions of PB2 FLPs with CO described the reactions of tBu3C6H2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)2 67 with 9-BBN resulting in the replacement of one C6F5 ring with a hydride giving tBu3C6H2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)(CH2CH2B(C6F5)H) 68. This species reacted with CO to give tBu3C6H2P(CH2CH2B-(C6F5)2)CH2CH2B(C6F5)(m-C(H)O) 69, the product of CO reduction (Scheme 10). Interestingly, the steric demands of the phosphorus substituent altered the chemistry. For example, reaction of C6H3(Mes)2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)2 70 with CO inducing the insertion of CO into the B–CH2 bond, leading to the ultimate formation of the macrocyclic species [(Mes)2C6H3PCH2CH2COB(C6F5)2CH2CH2B-(C6F5)2]2 71 (Fig. 2). 44 Similarly, iPr3C6H2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)2 72 reacted with CO to give the analogous trimeric species, [iPr3C6H2-PCH2CH2COB(C6F5)2CH2CH2B(C6F5)2]3 73 (Fig. 2). 44 3.5 Other main-group FLPs Van der Vlugt and coworkers45 reported the synthesis of the salt [Ph2SiCH2(C5H3MeN)][HB(C6F5)3] 74 and its reaction with CO. Computations showed that this proceeds via the generation of a formyl borate anion and an intermediate in which a bora-epoxide is coordinated to the Lewis acidic Si centre. Subsequent C6F5 transfers ultimately effected C–O bond cleavage to give [Ph2SiCH2(C5H3MeN)OB(C6F5)CH(C6F5)2] 75 (Scheme 11). In this case, the Lewis acidic silicon cation and the basic hydrido-borate act to prompt C–O cleavage. It is noteworthy that the corresponding [B(C6F5)4] salt does not react with CO.Scheme 8 Reaction of secondary phosphine-FLP with CO. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 | 46373.6 Insights The work described above extends the variety of B/P FLPs capable of capturing and activating CO. Stoichiometric reactivity affording reduction of CO and in some cases cleavage of the C–O bond. While this is interesting, the use of boon based Lewis acids is seen to led to reactivity of B–C bonds. This finding has inspired the use of other FLP combination targeting the exten-sion of the chemistry towards catalysis. 4. Transition metal FLPs As FLP chemistry expanded, the notion of what constitutes an FLP has also evolved. Among the earliest expansions of FLP chemistry beyond the p-block has been its application in transition metal chemistry.46,47 In a very early use of FLP type ligands in transition metal chemistry, Bercaw and coworkers48 described the reaction of the Re carbonyl species (Ph2PCH2CH2(9-BBN))2Re(CO)4 76 with H2 in the presence of the strong base (C4H8N)3PNtBu. This resulted in the reduction of CO affording the salt [(C4H8N)3PNtBuH] [(Ph2PCH2CH2(9-BBN))2Re(CO)2(COCH2O)] 77 (Scheme 12). In this case, further experimental data showed that the activation of H2 was affected by the FLP derived from the base and the pendant borane in the Re complex. In another 2011 study, Wass and corworkers49 explored the incorporation of early-metal centres as the Lewis acid centre of FLPs. While the Zr cation with a pendant phosphine in [Cp*2Zr(ClPh)OC6H4P(tBu)2][B(C6F5)4] 78 captured CO to give [Cp*2Zr(CO)OC6H4P(tBu)2][B(C6F5)4] 79, no interaction with the pendant basic phosphine was observed. This was attributed to the exceptionally high Lewis acidity of the Zr cation. In a similar sense, some years later, Erker and coworkers50 reported the related reaction of [Cp2ZrC6H4PPh2][B(C6F5)4] 80 with CO which led to insertion of CO into the Zr–C bond affording the Zr-acyl cation [Cp2ZrC(O)C6H4PPh2][B(C6F5)4] 81. Again, the phosphine fragments only served to stabilize the Zr cation and does not participate in the reaction with CO. Nonetheless, Wass and his team continued to explore transition metal derived FLPs. In one study51 they described the FLP derived from the electron rich Pt(0) species C6H4(CH2PtBu2)2Pt(CH2CH2) 82 4638 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023with B(C6F5)3. The reaction with CO resulted in the zwitterion C6H4(CH2PtBu2)2PtCH2CH2C(O)B(C6F5)3 83 (Scheme 13). In this case, CO adds to the olefin affording a five-membered metallocycle. Related chemistry was seen for the analogue C6H4(OPtBu2)2-Pt(CH2CH2) 84, 52 affording the product C6H4(OPtBu2)2PtCH2CH2-C(O)B(C6F5)3 85 (Scheme 13). Interestingly, the species C6H4-(CH2PtBu2)2Pt(CO) 86 was shown to react with CO2 in the presence of B(C6F5)3 to give the product of CO2 addition C6H4(CH2PtBu2)2-Pt(C(O))2O 87 (Scheme 13) that reversibly binds to the borane. 51 4.1 Insights While the work with transition metal FLPs and CO is limited, it does indicate that the concept can be applied to such systems, affording both CO capture and unique subsequent reactivity. This is an area, in which FLP are used in a cooperative fashion with transition metal chemistry is one that certainly has con-siderable potential for further development. 5. Alkali-metal species as FLPs The FLPs discussed above exploit combinations of electron-rich nucleophiles and electrophiles. In such cases, steric demands weaken dative bonding allowing the generation of the FLP. In the case of alkali-metal species, an analogous combination of a nucleophilic anion and a Lewis acidic metal ion present only electrostatic attractions thus precluding quenching of the acidity and basicity, directly analogous to FLPs. Indeed this perspective is consistent with our report in 2018, where we showed that group 1 metal-amides and -phosphides could be used to reversibly activate H2 and to effect hydrogenation catalysis. 53 This ability of alkali-metal species to behave as an FLP with H2 prompted the examina-tion of the reactivity of such species with other small molecules including CO. Certainly in the older literature, nucleophilic attack of CO by organolithium,54–64 Grignard65,66 and amides reagents67–70 has been extensively studied. However, our efforts have brought a new perspective to this chemistry as typically in the older work, the role of the Lewis acidic alkali metal is rarely considered. 5.1 Alkali-metal phosphides and CO In considering the reactions of alkali-metal phosphides with CO, we note the use of NaPH2 to prepare sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP) in 2011. While this reaction occurs under forcing con-ditions, it demonstrates nucleophilic attack at carbon of CO by phosphide.71 More recently, we reported the related reaction of KPtBu2 with CO under mild conditions. In this case, the for-mation of a transient anionic acyclic carbene is thought to induce a 1,2-tert-butyl group migration affording the acyl-phosphide anions [(18-crown-6)KNoneTHF2][E-tBuPQC(tBu)O] 88 as the major product (Scheme 14). Dimerization of the transient carbene gave lesser amounts of [K6(18-crown-6)][(tBu2PCO)2]3 89 containing the ene-diolate dianions (Scheme 14). The formation of the former species 88 is favoured under UV irradiation. In a similar fashion, 88 also reacted as a nucleophile with CO although the reaction was slow at ambient temperature. After 28 days, the species [K(18-crown-6)][(OCtBu)2P] 90 was formed and isolated (Scheme 14 similar to the formation of 88, nucleophilic attack of the P of 88 at CO with subsequent 1,2-tert-butyl migration to carbon. Related diacyl-phosphides were reported by Becker72–74 and Grützmacher75,76 while Goicoce-chea described related bis-carbamoyl phosphides.77 In related syntheses, phosphide attack of the CO fragment of Ph3GePCO 78 was used to generate a series of diphospha-ureas of the form (tBu)2PC(O)PR2 (R = GePh3, Me). 79 5.2 Alkali-metal carbanions and CO Analogous reactions of benzyl potassium derivatives with CO generate carbene-like intermediates as evidenced by the treat-ment of PhCH2K with CO and quenching with Ph3SiCl afforded the tetra-substituted olefin (PhCH2C(OSiPh3))2 91. 80 On the other hand, hydrolysis of the reaction mixture afforded PhCH2C(O)CH(OH)CH2Ph 92 (Scheme 15). The more sterically hindered benzyl potassium, K[2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2CH2] reacted with CO and subsequent addition of Me3SiCl gave the related olefinic species ((Me3SiO)(2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2CH2)C)2 93 as the major product (Scheme 15). In contrast, quenching the reaction with Ph3SiCl afforded the fused ring product tBu2C6H2(C(O-SiPh3)C(OSiPh3)CH2) 94. Quenching the reaction with water anaerobically, afforded a-hydroxy ketone (2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2)CH2-C(O)CH(OH)CH2(2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2) 95 (Scheme 15) while the 1,2-diketone species (2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2CH2CO)2 96 was favoured if the hydrolysis was performed in air. An even bulkier benzyl potassium derivative K[2,4,6-(3,5-tBu2C6H3)3C6H2CH2] reacted with CO to yielded a paramagnetic product 97, formulated as the radical anion salt K[3,5-(tBu)2C6H2C(O)C(O)CH2C6H2-(C6H33,5-(tBu)2)2]None on the basis of EPR data, while NMR data revealed the concurrent formation of the diamagnetic bis-alkoxide salt 98 (Scheme 15). Quenching the reaction with water provided the seven-membered aromatic species [3,5-(tBu)2C6H2C(O)C(OH)CHC6H2(C6H33,5-(tBu)2)2] 99 and the diketone ((2,4,6-(3,5-tBu2C6H3)3C6H2CH2C(O))2 100. A further study examined the reaction of the dilithio-species [(Ph2P(S))2-CLi2(THF)]2 81 in reaction with CO at room temperature. This led to the formation of a new C–C bond and migration of one of the phosphine-sulphide fragment affording the species formu-lated as [Ph2P(S)CC(P(S)Ph2)O]Li2 101. Although this species was not isolated, treatment with wet Et2O led to the isolation of This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 | 4639[Ph2P(S)CHC(P(S)Ph2)OLi(THF)]2 102 (Scheme 16). Exposure of solutions of 101 to 1 atm N2O at room temperature generated the anionic ketene Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2 102 and the by-product [Ph2P(S)OLi(THF)2]2 104 (Scheme 16). Heating of the mixture of 103/104 resulted in the cyclotrimerization of 103, generating the hexa-substituted benzene species [Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2]3 105 (Scheme 16) in an overall yield of 72%. It is noteworthy that a subsequent paper by Gessner and coworkers82 isolated and structurally characterized 103 derived from the reaction of [Ph2P(S)CHKPPh3] with CO. This strategy effects displacement of the PPh3, generating the metalated ketene K[Ph2P(S)CCO]. Subsequent reaction with a range of electrophiles affords a series of ketenes and related compounds. 5.3 Alkali-metal amides and CO As early as 1965, Na[N(SiMe3)2] was reported to react with CO at 80 1C and 100 atm pressure in hydrocarbon or aromatic solvent to generate NaCN.83 Recently we reported the analogous reaction of K[N(SiMe3)2] in C6D6 with 1 atm pressure of CO for 24 h at room temperature followed by heating to 50 1C for a further 24 h. This led to the formation of KCN in 64% yield. Repeating the reaction in THF at 50 1C improved the yield to 89% and the yield was further improved to 99% with the addition of 18-crown-6 and the use of 1,4-dioxane as the solvent. While under these latter condi-tions [(18-crown-6)KCN] 106 was isolated (Scheme 17), this protocol also provides an easily modifiable, transition metal-free route to 13CNNone. Mechanistically, this reaction is thought to proceed via nucleophilic attack of CO by amide, generating a carbene-like species. This species undergoes an 1,3-silyl group migration and elimination of siloxide to generate cyanide. This view was largely supported by DFT computations, although the intermediary isocyanide, Me3SiNC, was revealed. This prompted the corresponding reactions of sterically demanding silylamides of the form [(Me3Si)(R)N]M 107 (M = Li or K, R = tBu, adamantyl, 2-iPrC6H4, 2-PhC6H4, 2-Me-4-MeOC6H3, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2, 2,6-(Ph2CH)2-4-MeC6H2) with CO. In all cases, the corresponding isocyanides, 108 were obtained in yields ranging from 71 to 97% (Scheme 17). For sterically less demanding amides, Seyferth had reported some years ago that the reaction with CO afforded silylation of amidocarbomoyl lithium species derived from 1,2 silyl-migration.84,85 This prompted us to employ a more sterically demanding silyl-group to encourage 1,3-silyl migration. Indeed, for amides of the form [(Ph3Si)(R)N]M 109 (M = Li or K, R = 4-MeOC6H4, iPr, Bu, hexyl C6H5, 3-MeOC6H4, 4-Me2NC6H4, 4-PhOC6H4, 4-iPrC6H4, 2-picolyl) with CO, the corresponding 4640 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023isocyanides 110 were obtained in yields of 74–95% (Scheme 17). This facile protocol to isocyanides from CO and amide proved scalable to the gram scale and also provided a convenient route to the incorporation of a 13C label. In another study, we targeted reactions of amides with substituents that would not migrate. To this end, Cy2NLi (Cy = cyclohexyl) was reacted with 1 atm of CO. After 12 h, and following hydrolysis, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed a series of species of the formulae (Cy2N)2(CO)nH2 (n = 2–4) and (Cy2N)3(CO)nH3 (n = 3–7) consistent with homologation of CO. Slow evaporation of a THF extract of the reaction residue afforded Cy2NC(O)CH(OH)NCy2 111 which was isolated and fully charac-terized (Scheme 18). Alternatively, quenching the above reaction with Cy2BCl afforded the isolation of (Cy2B)(OCNCy2)2COBCy2 112 and (Cy2NCOBCy2)2C(m-O) 113, respectively (Scheme 18). While the former species was the major product, these species are isomers which incorporate three molecules of CO. The analogous reaction of Cy2NLi was using 4 atm of CO for 12 h at room temperature and quenching with Cy2BCl provided (Cy2NC(O)-CO)2(BCy2)2 114 derived from the catenation of four CO molecules (Scheme 18). In the context of the homologation of CO by alkali metal species salts, it is noteworthy that a series of intriguing papers from the groups of Jones18,86–89 and Hill90,91 have emerged in which reduced alkaline earth metal-species have been shown to effect CO homologation affording a variety of interesting species. Although this chemistry is not FLP chemistry, it does reflect the combined action of an electron source and a Lewis acidic centre, effecting the activation of CO. Given the above demonstration of CO homologation, this prompted an investigation of reactions with concurrent expo-sure to H2. Thus, reaction Cy2NLi with a 1 : 1 mixture of H2/CO was performed and the hexameric species [Cy2NCH2OLi]6 114 was found amongst the residues. In addition, the mass spectro-metry showed the formation as Cy2NC(O)CH2OH, 115. These products infer the generation of a carbene-type intermediate which reacts with H2 to give 114 or with CO and subsequently H2 to give 115 (Scheme 19). This notion was supported via isotopic labelling experiments which afforded the various iso-topomers of 115. A detailed computational study of these reactions showed the sequence of steps involving CO homologation were energetically accessible. At the same time, reaction of each of the intermediates with H2 was also accessible with slightly higher activation barriers, creating a competitive reaction pathway. While both C–C and C–H bond formations are accessible, the course of the reaction will be altered by the partial pressures of CO and H2. To our knowledge, this represents the first main group system to effect sequential C–C and C–H bond formations from CO and H2, the fundamental reactions of the transition metal mediated Fischer–Tropsch process.92 5.4 Insights The chemistry above demonstrates that viewing alkali metal species as FLPs is a credible approach. Simple amide and phosphide salts are shown to react with CO affording routes to C–C coupling products. Use of silyl amides provides routes to cyanide and isocyanides, while dialkyl amides afford unprece-dented avenues to CO homologation and further reactions with H2. These fundamental steps of Fischer–Tropsch chemistry under such remarkably mild conditions, suggest that further optimization of both the FLP and reactions conditions could provide reduction products of higher homologues of CO such as poly-ols, sugars or hydrocarbons. 6. Heterogeneous FLPs A variety of heterogeneous systems have been described which incorporate or behave as FLPs. These include surface-modified Au, polymers incorporating phosphine and borane units, molecular sieves, 2D materials and metal oxides. As the studies of such materials is relatively new, most applications have involved hydrogenation. This material has been recently reviewed.93 While several such system have been explored for hydrogena-tion and CO2 reduction catalysis, 94–100 reactions of CO with heterogeneous FLPs have drawn less attention to date. In 2019, Chen et al.101 described computations that considered the incorporation of boron decorated on a C2N monolayer. The results suggested this material is an efficient photocatalyst for CO reduction to C2H4 and C3H6. Most recently, Guo et al. 102 described the preparation of Au decorated hydroxyapatite (HAP)-CeO2. Employing a variety of spectroscopies, the Lewis acidic Ce3+ and a Lewis basic OHNone group on the surface were shown to enable the activation of O2 facilitating CO oxidation.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 | 46416.1 Insights The description of the reactivity sites on surfaces as FLPs provides a new perspective on the design of heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, as these heterogeneous catalysts are effective in mediat-ing the reduction or deoxygenation of CO, this further inspires molecular chemists to develop new FLP systems that mimic the reactivity of the heterogeneous systems. 7. Future perspective The range of small molecules that are captured and activated by FLPs has grown since the concept was first articulated in 2006 and 2007. This review has summarized progress in the FLP chemistry of CO. This work demonstrates the ability of classic B/P as well as a range of main group and transition metal FLPs to capture CO. While the establishment of the ability of FLPs to capture CO is interesting, the more recent work from Aldridge’s group clearly illustrates the potential for the advancement in CO sensing technologies. On the other hand, various p-block FLP systems are shown to undergo reactivity with CO and reducing agents, although such FLPs can also participate themselves in the reactiv-ity, thus precluding an avenue to catalysis. Nonetheless, these studies lay the fundamental groundwork for the development of synthetic applications. Extension of the concept to transition-and s-block metal species illustrates not only the wider implications of the FLP concepts, but also unveiled strategies to CO homologation. In addition, in the presence of syn-gas, these systems demonstrate the fundamental steps in Fischer–Tropsch chemistry. These obser-vations infer that C–C and C–H activations are both energetically accessible under mild conditions and suggest that tuning of the nature of the alkali metal FLP or perhaps other FLP systems could offer a strategy to favour higher CO homologs, suggesting the potential of transition metal-free routes to poly-ols, sugars or hydrocarbons. It is clear from the findings described herein, that while the concept of FLPs has evolved dramatically over the last almost two decades, it is now at a stage where it can provide a fundamentally unique approach to the challenging issues in small molecule chemistry and catalysis. While this review has focused on recent advances in FLP-CO chemistry, it is intriguing to consider that CO and N2 are isoelectronic. This notion suggests that chemists may begin to apply the lessons learned from FLP-CO chemistry to the challenge of metal-free Haber–Bosch chemistry. While is tough to predict what the future holds, it is clear that chemists will continue to develop new and exciting metal free chemistry by exploiting the notion of cooperative action of electron donors and acceptors.

        "2023Cite this: Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023,52,4632Frustrated Lewis pair chemistry of COTransition metal species readily capture and react with CO as the metal can act both as an acceptor and donor of electron density. In contrast, such a situation is less common in the main group and thus far fewer examples of main group CO adducts and their subsequent reactivity have been studied. In this review, we focus on the application of the concept of Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) to develop main group chemistry of CO. Specifically, we address reactions of FLPs that illustrate the ability to capture CO in addition to subsequent reactivity involving reduction with a variety of reagents. These developments illustrate that the donation and acceptance of electron density provided by FLPs is an alternative strategy to advance the reactivity of CO. Such insights augur well for future advances in the homogeneous chemistry of CO.",
        "1. Introduction Carbon monoxide (CO) is a common ligand in organometallic complexes. As a quintessential example of a ‘‘non-classic’’ ligand, it interacts with a metal centre via s-donation and acts as a p-acceptor by accepting metal d-orbital electron density into its p*-orbitals. This back-donation from the metal strengthens the metal–carbon bond accounting for the ability of metal to form carbonyl derivatives. In contrast, the interactions of CO with boron derivatives are much less common as these Lewis acidic species can accept donation from CO, but do not have low lying d-electrons avail-able for back donation. Consequently, it is only derivatives that offer very high Lewis acidity that are capable of forming isolable CO adducts. For example, as early as 1937, the species H3B(CO) was described (Fig. 1).1 In 2002, the species (F3C)3B(CO) was prepared and crystallographically characterized (Fig. 1).2 Subse-quently, in 2014 Erker and co-workers showed that Piers’ borane [HB(C6F5)2] forms an adduct with CO (Fig. 1). 3 More recently, theThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 |4633Erker group reported the use of a highly Lewis acidic cation to capture CO, affording the adduct [(IMes)BH(C6F5)(CO)] + (Fig. 1).4 Another more recent strategy has been to employ reduced B-species. Several such borylene species have been shown to capture CO (Fig. 1).5–7Concurrent with these efforts, the field of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry has emerged.8–14 This concept exploits combina-tions of donor and acceptor molecules to affect the activation of small molecules. While the initial findings were focused on dihydrogen activation15,16 and inferred that steric inhibition of adduct formation was essential, these views have also evolved. Indeed, FLP chemistry has been applied to the activation of wide range of small molecules including alkynes, olefins, CO2, N2O, SO2, SO, cyclopropanes, among others finding applications in organic synthesis, polymer chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.8–14 Moreover, explorations of the nature of FLPs have broadened our understanding regarding both the mode of action and the range of Lewis acids and bases that can act as FLPs.",
        "The long history of transition metals binding and activation of CO by acting as both an electron acceptor and donor, prompted questions about similar activation by the combined action of Lewis acids and bases. This notion together with the demonstrated ability of FLPs to effect catalytic metal-free hydrogenation, further prompted speculation of the possibility of transition metal-free mimics of classical Fischer–Tropsch chemistry.",
        "In this review, we discuss the recent developments in the FLP chemistry of CO. We begin by first describing conventional B/P FLP systems that capture CO (Section 2). This is followed by a discussion of stoichiometric reduction reactivity of CO with p-block FLPs (Section 3) and transition metal-based FLPs (Section 4). Stoichiometric reactivity of alkali metal-based FLPs providing syn-thetic routes to isocyanides and the homologation and reduction of CO are discussed (Section 5). The use of heterogeneous FLP systems in catalytic CO reduction is also presented (Section 6). We conclude with a discussion of the general lessons and a consideration of the future prospects for further development.",
        "2. CO capture The concept of using FLPs to capture CO is predicated on the notion that the donor and acceptor requirements, typically seen for CO binding to a transition metal do not need to reside on a single atom, but rather can be provided by separated donor and acceptor molecules. In this fashion, the potential for reduction chemistry of CO can be further expanded employing main group species.",
        "The demonstration of the ability of FLPs to capture CO was first described in 2010 for the boron-amidinate, HC(iPrN)2-B(C6F5)2 1 (Scheme 1). 17 Although the ring-opened amidinate (i.e. the FLP) was not spectroscopically observed, it is believed that transient separation of a donor nitrogen of the amidinate and the acceptor boron atom act in concert to capture CO to give HC(iPrN)2(CO)B(C6F5)2 2 (Scheme 1). A much more recent paper18 has reported a related system based on the ferrocenelinked bis-boron amidinate (tBuNQCHN(9-BBN)C5H4)2Fe. This species was shown to concurrently capture two molecules of CO while the related (tBuNCHN(B(C6F5)2)C5H4)2Fe 3 was able to capture CO2 and CO simultaneously to generate(tBuNCHNC-(O)(B(C6F5)2) C5H4)(tBuNCHNCO2(B(C6F5)2)C5H4)Fe 4 (Scheme 1). In a related fashion in 2017,19 the Erker group described the reaction of the B/N zwitterion C5H6Me4NQCHC(Me)HB(H)(C6F5)2 5 with CO in the presences of HB(C6F5)2 or B(C6F5)3. Interestingly, in these cases CO-insertion into the B–H bond and C–O coupling affords products of the form C5H6Me4NQCHC(Me)C(B(C6F5)2) (H)OC(O)(B(C6F5)2R) (R = H 6, C6F5 7) (Scheme 1). More recently, a 2021 report from Krempner and coworkers20 described the remarkable reaction of the B/N FLP C6H4(9-BBN)(NQC(NMe2)2) 8 with CO. While at room tempera-ture this species captures CO to give 9, at 120 1C the B and CO fragment swap places affording C6H4C(O)(9-BBN)(NQC(NMe2)2) 10 (Scheme 2). In contrast, in the presence of Me3SiO3SCF3 a further rearrangement occurs to give C6H4B(OSiMe3)(CC8H14) (NQC(NMe2)2) 11. Similarly in the presence of Al(C6F5)3,4634 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023C6H4B(OAl(C6F5)3)(CC8H14)(NQC(NMe2)2) 12 was obtained. In a related fashion the species 9 also reacts with electrophiles to induce B/C rearrangement, affording C6H4(CC8H14)BO(E(C6F5)3) (NQC(NMe2)2) (E = Al 13, B 14) (Scheme 2).",
        "Also in 2021, Aldridge and coworkers21 described the interaction of the NB2 species, (Ar2BC6H2Me)2(CMe2)NMe (Ar = C6H2(CF3)3 15, C6F5 16) with CO. At room temperature, these species captured CO to give 17/18, respectively. Reversible arene migrations from B to the carbonyl carbon generated 19 and 20 (Scheme 3). On warming, C6F5Me is lost with the formation of CO bridge between the two B atoms with a B–N bond formation (Ar2BC6H2Me)(CMe2)NCO-BAr(C6H2Me) (Ar = C6F5 21) (Scheme 3). In the additional presence of PtBu3, the methyl bound to N is transferred to phosphorus affording the phosphonium salts [tBu3PMe] [(Ar2BC6H2Me)2 (CMe2)NCO] (Ar = C6H2(CF3)3 22, C6F5 23) (Scheme 3). In contrast, addition of DMAP (DMAP = Me2NC5H4N) afforded coordination of the pyridyl nitrogen to give a four-coordinate boron centre of 19, affording (DMAP)(ArBC6H2Me)(CMe2)NC(Ar)OBAr(C6H2Me) (Ar = C6H2(CF3)3 24). Most notably, the tuning of the boron substituents in 15 permitted the initially colourless species to capture CO in the temperature range of 40–70 1C with a dramatic colour change to red upon formation of 17 and 19. This provides a colorimetric test for gaseous CO.",
        "2.1 Insights The early examples described above demonstrate the notion of CO capture by group 13/15 FLP combinations of Lewis acids and bases. In addition, Aldridge and coworkers21 have exploited such FLP capture of CO towards a sensor technology. While the concept of FLP based sensors is an intriguing one, the findings set the stage for the reactivity studies targeting chemistry of FLP sequestered CO.",
        "3. p-Block FLPs and reactivity of CO Given the established ability of FLPs to capture CO, the next obvious questions are around the notions of reactivity and the potential for reduction. Of course, the wide variety of inter-andintramolecular FLPs that are accessible provide a broad chemical landscape to address this question. Below, the reac-tivity of a number of conventional main group FLP systems with CO are discussed.",
        "3.1 Intermolecular P/B FLPs In a 2013 study,22 we explored the reactivity of the FLP tBu3P/ B(C6F5)3 with syn-gas (CO/H2). This afforded the salt [tBu3PH]-[(C6F5)3BC(H)OB(C6F5)3] 25 (Scheme 4). Warming this species induced the migration of C6F5 to the formyl-carbon atom, effecting the reduction of the CQO bond and affording the salt [tBu3PH]-[(C6F5)2BC(H)(C6F5)OB(C6F5)3] 26 (Scheme 4). This species reacted with H2 inducing the elimination of C6F5H, and the cleavage of the C–O bond affording the formation of salt of the anion [C6F5B-(CH2C6F5)OB(C6F5)3] None 27. On the other hand, 26 also reacted with additional CO effecting ring-expansion of the formyl-borane fragment affording the rare alkylcarboxylato-borate anion [(C6F5)2-BC(H)(C6F5)OCOB(C6F5)3] None 28 (Scheme 4).",
        "3.2 Intramolecular P/B FLPs Concurrent with the above studies, examination of the use of P/B intramolecular FLPs in reactions with CO were undertaken by the Erker group. This work began with the report of the exposure of P/B FLP Mes2PC7H10B(C6F5)2 29 to CO (Scheme 5). In an argon matrix at 10 K, no reaction was observed. However, on warming to ca. 35 K the borane-CO adduct was observed as evidenced by the IR stretching frequency at 2196 cmNone1. This is somewhat higher in wavenumbers than that observed for free CO.23 Reactions of 29 with CO in solution afforded the FLP/CO addition product Mes2PC7H10B(C6F5)2(CO) 30 (Scheme 5), which was only stable below 240 K. In this species binding of B/P to CO affords a trigonal planar geometry at C, while the CO stretching frequency was 1791 cmNone1. In 30, as in the FLP adducts 2 and 4, the CO fragment acts both as a s-donor and a p-acceptor. However, in contrast to the Dewar–Chatt–This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 |4635Duncanson model24,25 for the interactions of transition metals with CO, the acceptor and donor sites are disparate being on the B and P sites, respectively.",
        "In a subsequent effort, Erker et al.26 showed that the CO fragment in the FLP-CO adduct 29 was reduced via a net hydroboration in the presence of (C6F5)2BH yielding the epoxy-borate species, Mes2PC7H10B(C6F5)2(m-HCO)B(C6F5)2) 31 (Scheme 5). In a further study,27 the Erker group showed that treatment of 31 with pyridine generated the pyridine adduct of 29, 32 and the formyl-borane-pyridine adduct HC(O)B(C6F5)2(Py) 33. In this same report,27 the ‘‘Z2-formyl-borane’’ species 31 was reduced by H2 (60 bar) at 25 1C to yield C–O bond cleavage affording Mes2P(CH2)C7H10B(C6F5)2(m-OH)B(C6F5)2 34 (Scheme 5). The activation of H2 in this case is thought to result from the dissociation of the formyl-borane from the borane centre in 31. This generates a B/O FLP capable of heterolytic cleavage of H2 while subsequent hydride transfer from boron to carbon affords 34 (Scheme 5). In a related sense, borane/ether combinations were subsequently shown to be active for catalytic FLP hydrogenations of olefins.28Analogous Z2-formyl-borane species were also obtained from the FLPs, Mes2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2 26 (3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)2-PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2 29 and Mes2PC5H8B(C6F5)2 26,30 affording the formyl borane-derivatives 35–37, respectively (Scheme 6). The analogous chemistry with a ‘‘semi-triptycene’’ back-bone FLP (C6H4CHCH2)2PMes2B(C6F5)2 38 in reaction with CO gave (C6H4CHCH2)2PMes2(CH2)B(C6F5)2(m-OH)B(C6F5)2 39 (Scheme 6).31 In contrast, the formyl borane adduct Mes2PCH2-CH2B(C6F5)2(m-HCO)B(C6F5)2 35 reacted with pyridine to gen-erate the borane-pyridine adduct (py)B(C6F5)2CH2CH2PMes2 (m-HCO)B(C6F5)2 40 (Scheme 6). In a further study, 32 35 reacted with NO to effect C–N coupling with loss of a hydrogen radical generating HNO and the product Mes2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2 (m-(O)CQNO)B(C6F5)2 41 (Scheme 6). In a related fashion 35 also reacted with SO2 effecting insertion into the formylborato-ring to give Mes2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2(m-HC(B(C6F5)2)OSO2) 42 (Scheme 6).33 This capture of SO2 was subsequently shown to be reversible.343.3 Secondary intramolecular P/B FLPs The Erker group explored the inclusion of secondary B fragments in FLPs. The species Mes2PCH2CH2B(H)(C6H2(CF3)3) 43 35 reacted with CO, undergoing insertion into the B–H bond afforded the borato-epoxide species Mes2PCH2CH2B(m-HC(O))(C6H2(CF3)3) 44 (Scheme 7). The analogous CO addition product Mes2PCHQ4636 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023C(SiMe3)B(m-HC(O))(C6H2(CF3)3) 45 was also reported. 36 Species 44 was also shown to further react with HB(C6F5)2 to give Mes2PCH2CH2B(H)(m-HC(OB(C6F5)2)) (C6H2(CF3)3) 46 (Scheme 7). In a further subsequent study,37 compound 44 also reacted with CO2, isocyanate, and nitrile in the presence of B(C6F5)3 to effect C–C coupling reactions to give 47–49, respectively. Similarly, 44 in the presence of CO and B(C6F5)3 also effect C–C coupling to generate 50 which upon heating affords the enolate derivative 51 (Scheme 7).",
        "In a similar fashion, the FLP incorporating secondary phos-phine fragment was also probed.38 The reaction of the FLP (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6F5)2 52 (Scheme 8) with CO and HB(C6F5)2 gave (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6F5)(CH(B(C6F5)3)O) 53. Subsequent addition of this zwitterion with pyridine gave coordina-tion to boron and induced C6F5 transfer affording (tBu3C6H2)P(H)-CH2CH2B(C6F5)OCH(C6F5)B(C6F5)2(py) 54 (Scheme 8).",
        "The FLP incorporating both secondary phosphine and boranes, MesP(H)C(QCHtBu)B(C6H2(CF3)3)H 55 39 reacted with CO afford-ing the formaldehyde linkage between B and P in MesPC (QCHtBu)B(C6H2(CF3)3)(m-OCH2) 56. Treatment of 56 with N-phenyltriazolindione liberated formaldehyde and led to the for-mation of the cyclic FLP MesPC(QCHtBu)B(C6H2(CF3)3) (m-N2(C(O))2NPh) 57 (Scheme 9). In a subsequent 2020 paper, the Erker group40 described the reaction of the secondary PH/BH derived FLP (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)H 58 with CO, affording the formaldehyde-linked species (tBu3C6H2)P(H) CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)OCH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)CH2CH2P(H)(tBu3C6H2) 59 in which the CH2O fragment links two boron centres (Scheme 9). In contrast, reaction of 58 with B(C6F5)3 and CO gave (tBu3C6H2)P(H)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)CHO2CB(C6F5)3 60, while sub-sequent reaction with pyridine forms a dative bond with B(C6F5)3 and prompted a rearrangement to give the phosphine-oxide in which a CH2 group links the P and B centres, (tBu3C6H2)-P(O)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)(CH2) 61. While this species was a dimer in the solid state, in solution it slowly converted to (tBu3C6H2)P-Me(O)CH2CH2B(C6H2(CF3)3)OP(tBu3C6H2)CH2CH2B (C6H2(CF3)3(CH) 62 (Scheme 9).",
        "3.4 Intramolecular PB2 FLPs In a 2015 study,41 the Erker group described the hydroboration of Mes2PCCH with Piers borane followed by the addition of proton and hydride which further underwent a second hydro-boration affording Mes2P(H)C(B(m-H)(C6F5)2)HCH2B(C6F5)2 63. Addition of a second equivalent of Piers borane afforded the FLP containing one phosphorus and two boron centres, Mes2P-(H)C(B(m-H)(C6F5)2)HCH2B(C6F5)2 63. This species reacted with CO at 80 1C, inducing insertion into the B–H bond and C6F5 migration to give Mes2P(H)CHCH(B(C6F5)3) OB(C6F5)(CH2) 64(Scheme 10). In a closely related study,42 hydroboration of the phosphino-ene-yne Ph2PCRCC(Me)QCH2 and subsequent protonation, treatment with hydride and hydroboration afforded Ph2PCH2CH(Me)(CH(B(C6F5)2))2(m-H) 65. This species underwent a similar insertion of CO into the B–H bond, with C6F5 transfer yielding Ph2PCH2CH(Me) (CHB(C6F5)2)CHB-(C6F5)(m-OCH(C6F5)) 66 (Scheme 10). A further exploration43 of related reactions of PB2 FLPs with CO described the reactions of tBu3C6H2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)2 67 with 9-BBN resulting in the replacement of one C6F5 ring with a hydride giving tBu3C6H2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)(CH2CH2B(C6F5)H) 68. This species reacted with CO to give tBu3C6H2P(CH2CH2B-(C6F5)2)CH2CH2B(C6F5)(m-C(H)O) 69, the product of CO reduction (Scheme 10). Interestingly, the steric demands of the phosphorus substituent altered the chemistry. For example, reaction of C6H3(Mes)2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)2 70 with CO inducing the insertion of CO into the B–CH2 bond, leading to the ultimate formation of the macrocyclic species [(Mes)2C6H3PCH2CH2COB(C6F5)2CH2CH2B-(C6F5)2]2 71 (Fig. 2). 44 Similarly, iPr3C6H2P(CH2CH2B(C6F5)2)2 72 reacted with CO to give the analogous trimeric species, [iPr3C6H2-PCH2CH2COB(C6F5)2CH2CH2B(C6F5)2]3 73 (Fig. 2). 443.5 Other main-group FLPs Van der Vlugt and coworkers45 reported the synthesis of the salt [Ph2SiCH2(C5H3MeN)][HB(C6F5)3] 74 and its reaction with CO. Computations showed that this proceeds via the generation of a formyl borate anion and an intermediate in which a bora-epoxide is coordinated to the Lewis acidic Si centre. Subsequent C6F5 transfers ultimately effected C–O bond cleavage to give [Ph2SiCH2(C5H3MeN)OB(C6F5)CH(C6F5)2] 75 (Scheme 11). In this case, the Lewis acidic silicon cation and the basic hydrido-borate act to prompt C–O cleavage. It is noteworthy that the corresponding [B(C6F5)4] salt does not react with CO.Scheme 8 Reaction of secondary phosphine-FLP with CO.",

Stoichiometric reactivity affording reduction of CO and in some cases cleavage of the C–O bond. While this is interesting, the use of boon based Lewis acids is seen to led to reactivity of B–C bonds. This finding has inspired the use of other FLP combination targeting the exten-sion of the chemistry towards catalysis.",
        "4. Transition metal FLPs As FLP chemistry expanded, the notion of what constitutes an FLP has also evolved. Among the earliest expansions of FLPchemistry beyond the p-block has been its application in transition metal chemistry.46,47 In a very early use of FLP type ligands in transition metal chemistry, Bercaw and coworkers48 described the reaction of the Re carbonyl species (Ph2PCH2CH2(9-BBN))2Re(CO)4 76 with H2 in the presence of the strong base (C4H8N)3PNtBu. This resulted in the reduction of CO affording the salt [(C4H8N)3PNtBuH] [(Ph2PCH2CH2(9-BBN))2Re(CO)2(COCH2O)] 77 (Scheme 12). In this case, further experimental data showed that the activation of H2 was affected by the FLP derived from the base and the pendant borane in the Re complex. In another 2011 study, Wass and corworkers49 explored the incorporation of early-metal centres as the Lewis acid centre of FLPs. While the Zr cation with a pendant phosphine in [Cp*2Zr(ClPh)OC6H4P(tBu)2][B(C6F5)4] 78 captured CO to give [Cp*2Zr(CO)OC6H4P(tBu)2][B(C6F5)4] 79, no interaction with the pendant basic phosphine was observed. This was attributed to the exceptionally high Lewis acidity of the Zr cation. In a similar sense, some years later, Erker and coworkers50 reported the related reaction of [Cp2ZrC6H4PPh2][B(C6F5)4] 80 with CO which led to insertion of CO into the Zr–C bond affording the Zr-acyl cation [Cp2ZrC(O)C6H4PPh2][B(C6F5)4] 81. Again, the phosphine fragments only served to stabilize the Zr cation and does not participate in the reaction with CO. Nonetheless, Wass and his team continued to explore transition metal derived FLPs. In one study51 they described the FLP derived from the electron rich Pt(0) species C6H4(CH2PtBu2)2Pt(CH2CH2) 824638 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023with B(C6F5)3. The reaction with CO resulted in the zwitterion C6H4(CH2PtBu2)2PtCH2CH2C(O)B(C6F5)3 83 (Scheme 13). In this case, CO adds to the olefin affording a five-membered metallocycle. Related chemistry was seen for the analogue C6H4(OPtBu2)2-Pt(CH2CH2) 84, 52 affording the product C6H4(OPtBu2)2PtCH2CH2-C(O)B(C6F5)3 85 (Scheme 13). Interestingly, the species C6H4-(CH2PtBu2)2Pt(CO) 86 was shown to react with CO2 in the presence of B(C6F5)3 to give the product of CO2 addition C6H4(CH2PtBu2)2-Pt(C(O))2O 87 (Scheme 13) that reversibly binds to the borane. 514.1 Insights While the work with transition metal FLPs and CO is limited, it does indicate that the concept can be applied to such systems, affording both CO capture and unique subsequent reactivity. This is an area, in which FLP are used in a cooperative fashion with transition metal chemistry is one that certainly has con-siderable potential for further development.",
        "5. Alkali-metal species as FLPs The FLPs discussed above exploit combinations of electron-rich nucleophiles and electrophiles. In such cases, steric demands weaken dative bonding allowing the generation of the FLP. In the case of alkali-metal species, an analogous combination of a nucleophilic anion and a Lewis acidic metal ion present only electrostatic attractions thus precluding quenching of the acidity and basicity, directly analogous to FLPs. Indeed this perspective is consistent with our report in 2018, where we showed that group 1 metal-amides and -phosphides could be used to reversibly activate H2 and to effect hydrogenation catalysis. 53 This ability of alkali-metal species to behave as an FLP with H2 prompted the examina-tion of the reactivity of such species with other small molecules including CO. Certainly in the older literature, nucleophilic attack of CO by organolithium,54–64 Grignard65,66 and amides reagents67–70 has been extensively studied. However, our efforts have brought a new perspective to this chemistry as typically in the older work, the role of the Lewis acidic alkali metal is rarely considered.",
        "5.1 Alkali-metal phosphides and CO In considering the reactions of alkali-metal phosphides with CO, we note the use of NaPH2 to prepare sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP) in 2011. While this reaction occurs under forcing con-ditions, it demonstrates nucleophilic attack at carbon of CO by phosphide.71 More recently, we reported the related reaction of KPtBu2 with CO under mild conditions. In this case, the for-mation of a transient anionic acyclic carbene is thought to induce a 1,2-tert-butyl group migration affording the acyl-phosphide anions [(18-crown-6)KNoneTHF2][E-tBuPQC(tBu)O] 88 as the major product (Scheme 14). Dimerization of the transient carbene gave lesser amounts of [K6(18-crown-6)][(tBu2PCO)2]3 89 containing the ene-diolate dianions (Scheme 14). The formation of the former species 88 is favoured under UV irradiation.",
        "In a similar fashion, 88 also reacted as a nucleophile with CO although the reaction was slow at ambient temperature. After 28 days, the species [K(18-crown-6)][(OCtBu)2P] 90 wasformed and isolated (Scheme 14 similar to the formation of 88, nucleophilic attack of the P of 88 at CO with subsequent 1,2-tert-butyl migration to carbon. Related diacyl-phosphides were reported by Becker72–74 and Grützmacher75,76 while Goicoce-chea described related bis-carbamoyl phosphides.77 In related syntheses, phosphide attack of the CO fragment of Ph3GePCO 78 was used to generate a series of diphospha-ureas of the form (tBu)2PC(O)PR2 (R = GePh3, Me). 795.2 Alkali-metal carbanions and CO Analogous reactions of benzyl potassium derivatives with CO generate carbene-like intermediates as evidenced by the treat-ment of PhCH2K with CO and quenching with Ph3SiCl afforded the tetra-substituted olefin (PhCH2C(OSiPh3))2 91. 80 On the other hand, hydrolysis of the reaction mixture afforded PhCH2C(O)CH(OH)CH2Ph 92 (Scheme 15). The more sterically hindered benzyl potassium, K[2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2CH2] reacted with CO and subsequent addition of Me3SiCl gave the related olefinic species ((Me3SiO)(2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2CH2)C)2 93 as the major product (Scheme 15). In contrast, quenching the reaction with Ph3SiCl afforded the fused ring product tBu2C6H2(C(O-SiPh3)C(OSiPh3)CH2) 94. Quenching the reaction with water anaerobically, afforded a-hydroxy ketone (2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2)CH2-C(O)CH(OH)CH2(2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2) 95 (Scheme 15) while the 1,2-diketone species (2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2CH2CO)2 96 was favoured if the hydrolysis was performed in air. An even bulkier benzyl potassium derivative K[2,4,6-(3,5-tBu2C6H3)3C6H2CH2] reacted with CO to yielded a paramagnetic product 97, formulated as the radical anion salt K[3,5-(tBu)2C6H2C(O)C(O)CH2C6H2-(C6H33,5-(tBu)2)2]None on the basis of EPR data, while NMR data revealed the concurrent formation of the diamagnetic bis-alkoxide salt 98 (Scheme 15). Quenching the reaction with water provided the seven-membered aromatic species [3,5-(tBu)2C6H2C(O)C(OH)CHC6H2(C6H33,5-(tBu)2)2] 99 and the diketone ((2,4,6-(3,5-tBu2C6H3)3C6H2CH2C(O))2 100. A further study examined the reaction of the dilithio-species [(Ph2P(S))2-CLi2(THF)]2 81 in reaction with CO at room temperature. This led to the formation of a new C–C bond and migration of one of the phosphine-sulphide fragment affording the species formu-lated as [Ph2P(S)CC(P(S)Ph2)O]Li2 101. Although this species was not isolated, treatment with wet Et2O led to the isolation ofThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 |4639[Ph2P(S)CHC(P(S)Ph2)OLi(THF)]2 102 (Scheme 16). Exposure of solutions of 101 to 1 atm N2O at room temperature generated the anionic ketene Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2 102 and the by-product [Ph2P(S)OLi(THF)2]2 104 (Scheme 16). Heating of the mixture of 103/104 resulted in the cyclotrimerization of 103, generating the hexa-substituted benzene species [Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2]3 105 (Scheme 16) in an overall yield of 72%. It is noteworthy that a subsequent paper by Gessner and coworkers82 isolated and structurally characterized 103 derived from the reaction of [Ph2P(S)CHKPPh3] with CO. This strategy effects displacement of the PPh3, generating the metalated ketene K[Ph2P(S)CCO]. Subsequent reaction with a range of electrophiles affords a series of ketenes and related compounds.",
        "5.3 Alkali-metal amides and CO As early as 1965, Na[N(SiMe3)2] was reported to react with CO at 80 1C and 100 atm pressure in hydrocarbon or aromatic solvent to generate NaCN.83 Recently we reported the analogous reaction of K[N(SiMe3)2] in C6D6 with 1 atm pressure of CO for 24 h at room temperature followed by heating to 50 1C for a further 24 h. This led to the formation of KCN in 64% yield. Repeating the reaction in THF at 50 1C improved the yield to 89% and the yield was further improved to 99% with the addition of 18-crown-6 and the use of 1,4-dioxane as the solvent. While under these latter condi-tions [(18-crown-6)KCN] 106 was isolated (Scheme 17), thisprotocol also provides an easily modifiable, transition metal-free route to 13CNNone. Mechanistically, this reaction is thought to proceed via nucleophilic attack of CO by amide, generating a carbene-like species. This species undergoes an 1,3-silyl group migration and elimination of siloxide to generate cyanide. This view was largely supported by DFT computations, although the intermediary isocyanide, Me3SiNC, was revealed. This prompted the corresponding reactions of sterically demanding silylamides of the form [(Me3Si)(R)N]M 107 (M = Li or K, R = tBu, adamantyl, 2-iPrC6H4, 2-PhC6H4, 2-Me-4-MeOC6H3, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2,4,6-(tBu)3C6H2, 2,6-(Ph2CH)2-4-MeC6H2) with CO. In all cases, the corresponding isocyanides, 108 were obtained in yields ranging from 71 to 97% (Scheme 17). For sterically less demanding amides, Seyferth had reported some years ago that the reaction with CO afforded silylation of amidocarbomoyl lithium species derived from 1,2 silyl-migration.84,85 This prompted us to employ a more sterically demanding silyl-group to encourage 1,3-silyl migration. Indeed, for amides of the form [(Ph3Si)(R)N]M 109 (M = Li or K, R = 4-MeOC6H4, iPr, Bu, hexyl C6H5, 3-MeOC6H4, 4-Me2NC6H4, 4-PhOC6H4, 4-iPrC6H4, 2-picolyl) with CO, the corresponding4640 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023isocyanides 110 were obtained in yields of 74–95% (Scheme 17). This facile protocol to isocyanides from CO and amide proved scalable to the gram scale and also provided a convenient route to the incorporation of a 13C label.",
        "In another study, we targeted reactions of amides with substituents that would not migrate. To this end, Cy2NLi (Cy = cyclohexyl) was reacted with 1 atm of CO. After 12 h, and following hydrolysis, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed a series of species of the formulae (Cy2N)2(CO)nH2 (n = 2–4) and (Cy2N)3(CO)nH3 (n = 3–7) consistent with homologation of CO. Slow evaporation of a THF extract of the reaction residue afforded Cy2NC(O)CH(OH)NCy2 111 which was isolated and fully charac-terized (Scheme 18). Alternatively, quenching the above reaction with Cy2BCl afforded the isolation of (Cy2B)(OCNCy2)2COBCy2 112 and (Cy2NCOBCy2)2C(m-O) 113, respectively (Scheme 18). While the former species was the major product, these species are isomers which incorporate three molecules of CO. The analogous reaction of Cy2NLi was using 4 atm of CO for 12 h at room temperature and quenching with Cy2BCl provided (Cy2NC(O)-CO)2(BCy2)2 114 derived from the catenation of four CO molecules (Scheme 18).",
        "In the context of the homologation of CO by alkali metal species salts, it is noteworthy that a series of intriguing papers from the groups of Jones18,86–89 and Hill90,91 have emerged in which reduced alkaline earth metal-species have been shown to effect CO homologation affording a variety of interesting species. Although this chemistry is not FLP chemistry, it does reflect the combined action of an electron source and a Lewis acidic centre, effecting the activation of CO.",
        "Given the above demonstration of CO homologation, this prompted an investigation of reactions with concurrent expo-sure to H2. Thus, reaction Cy2NLi with a 1 : 1 mixture of H2/CO was performed and the hexameric species [Cy2NCH2OLi]6 114 was found amongst the residues. In addition, the mass spectro-metry showed the formation as Cy2NC(O)CH2OH, 115. These products infer the generation of a carbene-type intermediate which reacts with H2 to give 114 or with CO and subsequently H2 to give 115 (Scheme 19). This notion was supported via isotopic labelling experiments which afforded the various iso-topomers of 115.",
        "A detailed computational study of these reactions showed the sequence of steps involving CO homologation were energetically accessible. At the same time, reaction of each of the intermediates with H2 was also accessible with slightly higher activation barriers, creating a competitive reaction pathway. While both C–C and C–H bond formations are accessible, the course of the reaction will be altered by the partial pressures of CO and H2. To our knowledge, this represents the first main group system to effect sequential C–C and C–H bond formations from CO and H2, the fundamental reactions of the transition metal mediated Fischer–Tropsch process.92 5.4 Insights The chemistry above demonstrates that viewing alkali metal species as FLPs is a credible approach. Simple amide and phosphide salts are shown to react with CO affording routes to C–C coupling products. Use of silyl amides provides routes to cyanide and isocyanides, while dialkyl amides afford unprece-dented avenues to CO homologation and further reactions with H2. These fundamental steps of Fischer–Tropsch chemistry under such remarkably mild conditions, suggest that further optimization of both the FLP and reactions conditions could provide reduction products of higher homologues of CO such as poly-ols, sugars or hydrocarbons.",
        "6. Heterogeneous FLPs A variety of heterogeneous systems have been described which incorporate or behave as FLPs. These include surface-modified Au, polymers incorporating phosphine and borane units, molecular sieves, 2D materials and metal oxides. As the studies of such materials is relatively new, most applications have involved hydrogenation. This material has been recently reviewed.93 While several such system have been explored for hydrogena-tion and CO2 reduction catalysis, 94–100 reactions of CO with heterogeneous FLPs have drawn less attention to date. In 2019, Chen et al.101 described computations that considered the incorporation of boron decorated on a C2N monolayer. The results suggested this material is an efficient photocatalyst for CO reduction to C2H4 and C3H6. Most recently, Guo et al. 102 described the preparation of Au decorated hydroxyapatite (HAP)-CeO2. Employing a variety of spectroscopies, the Lewis acidic Ce3+ and a Lewis basic OHNone group on the surface were shown to enable the activation of O2 facilitating CO oxidation.",
        "This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4632–4643 |46416.1 Insights The description of the reactivity sites on surfaces as FLPs provides a new perspective on the design of heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, as these heterogeneous catalysts are effective in mediat-ing the reduction or deoxygenation of CO, this further inspires molecular chemists to develop new FLP systems that mimic the reactivity of the heterogeneous systems.",
        "7. Future perspective The range of small molecules that are captured and activated by FLPs has grown since the concept was first articulated in 2006 and 2007. This review has summarized progress in the FLP chemistry of CO. This work demonstrates the ability of classic B/P as well as a range of main group and transition metal FLPs to capture CO.",
        "While the establishment of the ability of FLPs to capture CO is interesting, the more recent work from Aldridge’s group clearly illustrates the potential for the advancement in CO sensing technologies. On the other hand, various p-block FLP systems are shown to undergo reactivity with CO and reducing agents, although such FLPs can also participate themselves in the reactiv-ity, thus precluding an avenue to catalysis. Nonetheless, these studies lay the fundamental groundwork for the development of synthetic applications. Extension of the concept to transition-and s-block metal species illustrates not only the wider implications of the FLP concepts, but also unveiled strategies to CO homologation. In addition, in the presence of syn-gas, these systems demonstrate the fundamental steps in Fischer–Tropsch chemistry. These obser-vations infer that C–C and C–H activations are both energetically accessible under mild conditions and suggest that tuning of the nature of the alkali metal FLP or perhaps other FLP systems could offer a strategy to favour higher CO homologs, suggesting the potential of transition metal-free routes to poly-ols, sugars or hydrocarbons.",
        "It is clear from the findings described herein, that while the concept of FLPs has evolved dramatically over the last almost two decades, it is now at a stage where it can provide a fundamentally unique approach to the challenging issues in small molecule chemistry and catalysis. While this review has focused on recent advances in FLP-CO chemistry, it is intriguing to consider that CO and N2 are isoelectronic. This notion suggests that chemists may begin to apply the lessons learned from FLP-CO chemistry to the challenge of metal-free Haber–Bosch chemistry. While is tough to predict what the future holds, it is clear that chemists will continue to develop new and exciting metal free chemistry by exploiting the notion of cooperative action of electron donors and acceptors.",
