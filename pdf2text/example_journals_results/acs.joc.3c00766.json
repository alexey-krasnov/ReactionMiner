Mechanistic investigation proved that water acts as a source of hydrogen for the reduction of the nitro group and the reaction rate was accelerated by an aldehyde.

In addition, the photophysical study showed blue fluorescence emission with a good fluorescence quantum yield.  INTRODUCTION Fused N-heteropolycycles are an important class of organic compounds which have gained sufficient attention due to their wide range of medicinal and pharmacological applications.1 Specifically, quinazolinone and quinazolinone-fused com-pounds are reported to have a broad range of pharmacological roles, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, diuretic, anti-convulsant, and antihypertensive agents.2 Some examples of natural products and bioactive molecules having a quinazoli-none-fused tetracyclic framework, such as luotonin A, tryptanthrin, auranthine, and rutecarpine, have been depicted in Figure 1.3-5 Due to the extensive biological significance of quinazoli-none-fused compounds (Figure 1), numerous synthetic methods have been established for the synthesis of such fused N-heterocycles. Among them, transition-metal-catalyzed reactions have gotten attention for the past few years.6 Although sufficient progress has been made in this direction, the synthesis of those molecules using C-N-bond-forming reactions remains a challenge because C-N-bond-forming reactions require the use of expensive catalysts, harsh reaction conditions, and toxic reagents.7-9 Thus, an efficient and straightforward strategy to synthesize quinazolinone-fused N-heterocycles is a challenging task for the synthetic organic chemist. It motivated us to develop an efficient protocol for the synthesis of those heteropolycyclic compounds via a cost-effective method. In 2017, Feng and co-workers reported a Pd-Cu-catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction for the synthesis of fused, polycyclic compounds through C-N and C-C bond formation starting from 2-phenyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone (Scheme 1).10 Recently, in 2021, Malasala and co-workers reported a microwave-assisted, copper-mediated approach for the synthesis of fused quinazoline derivatives starting from 2-(2-bromophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-ones.11 In the same year, Wang and co-workers unveiled a Ru(II)-catalyzed C-C/C-N annulation reaction for the synthesis of fused quinazolinones from 2-arylquinazolinones with vinylene (Scheme 1).12 There are few approaches for the synthesis of those fused heteropolycyclic compounds starting from either 2-phenyl-quinazolin-4(3H)-ones or 2-(2-bromophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-ones; however, there is one report where 2-(2-Received: April 7, 2023 nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one was used as a starting material for the synthesis of 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones.13 This reaction’s limitations were that it was applied to only primary alcohols, required a large excess of SnCl2, and had a limited substrate scope. Therefore, the development of an efficient and convenient method for the synthesis of fused, heteropolycyclic compounds is desirable. Iron is the least expensive and nearly the least hazardous element compared to other metals on the periodic table; however, it has not been used much in organic synthesis as a reaction mediator. This is probably because iron is not very reactive and there are not any good ways to make it more reactive.14 Among the iron-based reagents, mostly Fe/HCl and Fe/NH4Cl are used for the reduction of nitro groups. 15 From a modern perspective, those reagents are certainly not environ-mentally friendly. Herein, we disclose an efficient and regioselective one-pot protocol for the synthesis of novel biheterocyclic 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones starting from 2-(2-nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one. The reaction proceeded through an iron-mediated, one-pot reductive cyclization process. Mechanistic studies indicate that water was acting as a source of hydrogen for the reduction of the nitro group, which was proven by the deuterium-labeling experiment. In this reaction, aldehyde had a crucial role, which accelerated the conversion of the starting material to the product. The substrate scope of the reaction, functional group tolerance, and photophysical studies of the synthesized, novel compounds are unveiled in this study.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION As a continuation of our ongoing efforts toward the synthesis of fused N-heterocycles16 and their photophysical studies,16a we developed a one-pot synthesis of quinazolinone starting from 2-nitrobenzaldehyde with an aldehyde.16b We were interested in constructing quinazolinone-fused N-heterocycles. Toward this, our work was initiated with 2-(2-nitrophenyl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1a)16c as a starting material. At the beginning, compound 1a was subjected to various reaction conditions to obtain the desired product. Based on previous studies, compound 1a was reacted with Cu(OAc)2 (20 mol %), N2H4·H2O (3 equiv), and benzaldehyde (1.2 equiv) in a DMSO solvent at 110 °C to get the desired product (Table 1, entry 1). However, the reaction did not result in the formation of the product; instead, a complex TLC was observed. Changing the solvent to isopropyl alcohol also did not result in product formation (Table 1, entry 2). When N2H4·H2O was replaced with NaBH4 in an isopropyl alcohol solvent, the desired product was formed with a 25% conversion of the starting material to the product. Doubling the number of equivalents of NaBH4 resulted in a slight increase in the yield of the reaction (Table 1, entry 4). The reaction was also performed with a stoichiometric and excess amount of Cu(OAc)2, but the yield was not improved. Under the basic medium, in the presence of KOtBu, the reaction gave only 30% conversion to the product (Table 1, entry 5). Changes in the number of equivalents of KOtBu or Cu(OAc)2 or the addition of other metal catalysts did not improve the results (Table 1, entries 6-10). In the presence of only a copper catalyst, the reaction did not yield the product (Table 1, entry 11). Changing the solvent to DMSO or DMA and adding NH4Cl instead of KOtBu led to the formation of a small amount of the product (Table 1, entries 12-14). In the presence of Fe powder and NH4Cl in an isopropanol solvent, the reaction produced a higher yield (Table 1, entries 15-17). A solvent system of isopropyl alcohol and water (4:1) gave a good yield in the absence of NH4Cl (Table 1, entries 18-20). The reaction did not give rise to product formation in the absence of Fe powder (Table 1, entry 21). The best yield was observed in the presence of 3 equiv of Fe powder in an isopropanol:-water (4:1) solvent system (Table 1, entry 20). Finally, the reaction was performed with only an isopropanol:water (4:1) solvent system, but a better yield was not observed. Various other solvents (such as MeOH, EtOH, tBuOH, HFIP, 1,4-dioxane, THF, DMF, DCE, DMAc, acetonitrile, toluene, and xylene) were also screened; however, those solvents did not give rise to a better yield. After having optimized the reaction conditions (Fe powder (3 equiv), aldehydes (1.5 equiv), 2.5 mL of isopropanol, 0.5 mL of H2O, 110 °C), various electronically and sterically varied aldehydes (2a) were reacted with 2-(2-nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1a) to see the substrate diversity of the reaction. A series of quinazolinone-fused heterocycles (3) were obtained smoothly with yields of 58-86% (Scheme 2). Substrates containing electron-donating groups afforded the correspond-ing products (3b and 3c) in 78% and 77% yields, respectively. Substrates containing halogen atoms produced the correspond-ing products (3d-3i) in 68-86% yields. A highly conjugated polycyclic-ring-containing substrate (3j) was also synthesized; however, the yield of the reaction was much lower (58%). This low yield could be explained by the lower reactivity of the polycyclic, conjugated starting aldehyde (2j). The reaction was further explored for the synthesis of novel bi-aryl electron-donating and electron-withdrawing-group-containing compounds (3k-3m) with yields of 78-85%. Heterocyclic aldehydes (2o and 2p) also reacted smoothly to give the corresponding products (3o and 3p) in 61% and 74% yields, respectively. The reaction was also well-suited for the aliphatic aldehydes and gave the corresponding products (3q and 3t) with 69-74% yields. Synthesis of Bio-Inspired Molecular Scaffolds. Com-pounds containing derivatives of piperidine,17 morpholine,18 or piperazine19 are prone to show antitubercular activities.19,20 Considering their biological importance, we attempted to synthesize dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-one deriva-tives containing a piperidine, morpholine, or piperazine motif to study their fluorescence properties. Toward this, a series of aldehydes (2a′-2e′) were synthesized and subjected to a reaction with compound 1a. It was found that those aldehydes (2a′-2e′) reacted smoothly with compound 1a, giving the corresponding products (4a-4e) in 65-78% yields (Scheme 3). To see the applicability of the reaction in gram-scale synthesis, the reaction was carried out with 1.2 g of the starting material under standardized conditions (Scheme 4). It was observed that the reaction went smoothly to give the corresponding product in a 73% yield, which suggests that this is a scalable method for the synthesis of dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones. To understand the mechanism of the reaction, control experiments were conducted, as shown in Scheme 5. The reaction was conducted in the absence of aldehyde, and it was observed that only the nitro group was reduced to give product 5 (Scheme 5, (i)). This experiment indicates that intermediate 5 is formed during the reaction. However, conversion of the starting material 1a to the intermediate 5 was only 30% after 24 h. The addition of the aldehyde to the reaction mixture resulted in its complete conversion into the product, indicating that the aldehyde is accelerating the reaction rate by reacting with an amine (5), formed in situ, in the reaction medium. Further, the reaction did not give rise to product formation in the absence of H2O, indicating the essential role of water in the reaction medium (Scheme 5, (ii)). When the reaction was performed in the absence of an aldehyde and in the presence of a D2O:isopropanol solvent system, deuterated product 5D was formed (Scheme 5, (iii)), which clearly indicates that, during the reduction process, hydrogen came from water. From that, it can be stated that H2O is used as a source of hydrogen in the reduction process to form intermediate 5 from the starting material 1a. The reaction produced the desired product in good yield in the presence of BTH, proving that it does not proceed via a radical pathway (Scheme 5, (iv)). Therefore, it can be stated that the reaction is going through an electron transfer mechanism. The reaction resulted in 54% conversion to the product when it was conducted only in water in the absence of 2-propanol (Scheme 5, (v)). This could be explained by the lower solubility of the starting material in water. Based on the control experiments and earlier literature reports, a mechanism is proposed in Scheme 6. In the first step, the nitro group present in compound 1a is reduced to form an amine intermediate (I) in the presence of Fe powder and water via an electron transfer mechanism. Then this amine intermediate (I) reacts with aldehydes (2a) to form an imine intermediate (II), which undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the desired product (3a). Photophysical Studies. With the diverse 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones in hand, we turned our attention to the study of the photophysical properties of those synthesized compounds (3j-4e) as shown in Table 2. Fluorescence emission spectra and UV-vis spectra of the synthesized novel compounds (3j-4e) were measured in DCM at a 5 × 10-6 mol/L concentration. The fluorescence emission spectra of the compounds are presented in Figure 2. The UV-vis study showed that the absorption band of compounds 3j-4e covers 250-430 nm and consists of two to three absorption peaks, which are ascribed to π-π* and n-π* charge transfer transitions. The compounds (3j-4e) have shown a blue fluorescence emission with a quantum yield (ΦF) up to 0.72. A bathochromic shift in absorption wavelength was observed for compound 4a. Exceptionally high emission maxima (493 nm) were observed for compound 4a compared to others with a quantum yield (ΦF) of 0.14. Compound 4e has shown the minimum absorption wavelength with a quantum yield (ΦF) of 0.45. The maximum quantum yield (ΦF = 0.72) was observed for compound 3l with an absorption wavelength of 305 nm.  CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we have developed an efficient and regioselective one-pot protocol for the synthesis of novel biheterocyclic 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones starting from 2-(2-nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one. The reaction proceeded through an iron-powder-mediated, one-pot reductive cyclization process. Mechanistic studies revealed that water was acting as a source of hydrogen for the reduction of the nitro group, which was proven by the deuterium-labeling experiment. In this reaction, the aldehyde had played a significant role, accelerating the reduction process by converting an amine, formed in situ, to the product. The reaction has shown a wide substrate scope with a high yield and a high functional group tolerance. In addition, several bio-inspired molecular scaffolds have also been synthesized. The photophysical properties of the synthesized fused compounds were studied and found to show blue fluorescence emission with a moderate to good fluorescence quantum yield. The outcomes provided here might be of great relevance in the fields of medicinal chemistry and materials science.  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Information. All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from commercial suppliers and utilized without additional purification. Silica gel with a mesh size of 100-200 was used for column chromatography purifications. Without additional purification, commercial-grade chemicals and solvents were used. Experiments involving moisture-or air-sensitive chemicals were carried out in oven-dried glassware under positive nitrogen or argon pressure and using freshly distilled solvents. Merck 60 F254 precoated silica gel plates of 0.2 mm thickness were used for analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC). During elution of the column, TLC plates were viewed using UV radiation (254 nm) on a Spectroline model ENF-24061/F 254 nm instrument. Flash chromatography was carried out with the specified solvent system and 60-120 mesh silica gel. Typically, columns were packed as slurry and pre-equilibrated with the appropriate solvent system before use. High-resolution mass spectral analysis (HRMS) was carried out on a Bruker Daltonics MicroTOF-Q-II mass spectrometer using MeOH as a solvent, and an electrospray ionization (ESI) positive method was used. A Bruker 400 NMR spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H, 100 MHz for 13C) was used to record the 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of the synthesized compounds. For 1H NMR spectra, chemical shifts are reported as δ in units of parts per million (ppm) relative to the signal of chloroform-d (δ 7.26, singlet). Multiplicities were given as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), dd (doublet of doublets), dt (doublet of triplets), or m (multiplet). For a given resonance, the number of protons (n) is indicated by nH. Coupling constants (J value) are reported in hertz (Hz). For 13C{1H} NMR spectra, chemical shifts are reported as δ in units of parts per million (ppm) downfield from TMS (δ 0.0) and relative to the signal of chloroform-d (δ 77.0, triplet). Synthesis of Compound 1a.16c Anthranilamide (1 mmol), substituted benzaldehydes (1.1 mmol), and CuCl2·2H2O (2 mmol) in ethanol (15 mL) were added to an oven-dried, round-bottom flask. The reaction mixture was then refluxed for 16 h in an oil bath, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and distilled water was added until precipitates formed. The precipitates were filtered and washed with distilled water. The product 1a was obtained as a pale yellow solid: yield 88% (231 mg); Rf = 0.3 (40% EtOAc + pet ether); 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 12.83 (1 H, s), 8.20 (2 H, t, J = 9.0), 8.00-7.77 (4 H, m), 7.66 (1 H, d, J = 8.1), 7.57 (1 H, t, J = 7.5); 13C{1H} NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 161.9, 152.1, 149.0, 147.9, 135.1, 134.4, 132.0, 131.9, 129.6, 127.8, 127.6, 126.3, 125.0, 121.6. General Procedure for the Synthesis of 5,6-Dihydro-8H-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones. One millimole of com-pound 1a, 2 mL of isopropanol, 0.5 mL of H2O, Fe powder (3 equiv), and substituted aldehydes of type 2 (1.5 equiv) were added to an oven-dried, round-bottom flask and allowed to reflux in an oil bath until completion (12-24 h, confirmed by TLC). After completion, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL) and water (10 mL). After separation of the aqueous and organic layers, the aqueous layer was further extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic layer was collected and washed with a brine solution (10 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude reaction mixture was purified by silica gel (100-200) column chromatography to obtain the desired product of type 3.

        "An Aldehyde-Driven, Fe(0)-Mediated, One-Pot Reductive Cyclization: Direct Access to 5,6-Dihydro-quinazolino[4,3‑b]quinazolin-8-ones and Photophysical Study",
        "ABSTRACT: A short, proficient, and regioselective synthesis of biheterocyclic 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones has been revealed via an Fe(0)-powder-mediated, one-pot reductive cyclization protocol. Mechanistic investigation proved that water acts as a source of hydrogen for the reduction of the nitro group and the reaction rate was accelerated by an aldehyde. The designed transformation works under aerobic conditions, providing a series of bio-inspired molecular scaffolds. In addition, the photophysical study showed blue fluorescence emission with a good fluorescence quantum yield.",
        "INTRODUCTION Fused N-heteropolycycles are an important class of organic compounds which have gained sufficient attention due to their wide range of medicinal and pharmacological applications.1 Specifically, quinazolinone and quinazolinone-fused com-pounds are reported to have a broad range of pharmacological roles, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, diuretic, anti-convulsant, and antihypertensive agents.2 Some examples of natural products and bioactive molecules having a quinazoli-none-fused tetracyclic framework, such as luotonin A, tryptanthrin, auranthine, and rutecarpine, have been depicted in Figure 1.3-5Due to the extensive biological significance of quinazoli-none-fused compounds (Figure 1), numerous synthetic methods have been established for the synthesis of such fused N-heterocycles. Among them, transition-metal-catalyzed reactions have gotten attention for the past few years.6 Although sufficient progress has been made in this direction, the synthesis of those molecules using C-N-bond-forming reactions remains a challenge because C-N-bond-forming reactions require the use of expensive catalysts, harsh reaction conditions, and toxic reagents.7-9 Thus, an efficient and straightforward strategy to synthesize quinazolinone-fused N-heterocycles is a challenging task for the synthetic organic chemist. It motivated us to develop an efficient protocol for the synthesis of those heteropolycyclic compounds via a cost-effective method.",
        "In 2017, Feng and co-workers reported a Pd-Cu-catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction for the synthesis of fused, polycyclic compounds through C-N and C-C bond formation starting from 2-phenyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone (Scheme 1).10 Recently, in 2021, Malasala and co-workers reported a microwave-assisted, copper-mediated approach for the synthesis of fused quinazoline derivatives starting from 2-(2-bromophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-ones.11 In the same year, Wang and co-workers unveiled a Ru(II)-catalyzed C-C/C-N annulation reaction for the synthesis of fused quinazolinones from 2-arylquinazolinones with vinylene (Scheme 1).12 There are few approaches for the synthesis of those fused heteropolycyclic compounds starting from either 2-phenyl-quinazolin-4(3H)-ones or 2-(2-bromophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-ones; however, there is one report where 2-(2-nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one was used as a starting material for the synthesis of 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones.13 This reaction’s limitations were that it was applied to only primary alcohols, required a large excess of SnCl2, and had a limited substrate scope. Therefore, the development of an efficient and convenient method for the synthesis of fused, heteropolycyclic compounds is desirable.",
        "Iron is the least expensive and nearly the least hazardous element compared to other metals on the periodic table; however, it has not been used much in organic synthesis as a reaction mediator. This is probably because iron is not very reactive and there are not any good ways to make it more reactive.14 Among the iron-based reagents, mostly Fe/HCl and Fe/NH4Cl are used for the reduction of nitro groups. 15 From a modern perspective, those reagents are certainly not environ-mentally friendly.",
        "Herein, we disclose an efficient and regioselective one-pot protocol for the synthesis of novel biheterocyclic 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones starting from 2-(2-nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one. The reaction proceededthrough an iron-mediated, one-pot reductive cyclization process. Mechanistic studies indicate that water was acting as a source of hydrogen for the reduction of the nitro group, which was proven by the deuterium-labeling experiment. In this reaction, aldehyde had a crucial role, which accelerated the conversion of the starting material to the product. The substrate scope of the reaction, functional group tolerance, and photophysical studies of the synthesized, novel compounds are unveiled in this study.",
        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION As a continuation of our ongoing efforts toward the synthesis of fused N-heterocycles16 and their photophysical studies,16a we developed a one-pot synthesis of quinazolinone starting from 2-nitrobenzaldehyde with an aldehyde.16b We were interested in constructing quinazolinone-fused N-heterocycles. Toward this, our work was initiated with 2-(2-nitrophenyl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1a)16c as a starting material. At the beginning, compound 1a was subjected to various reaction conditions to obtain the desired product. Based on previous studies, compound 1a was reacted with Cu(OAc)2 (20 mol %), N2H4·H2O (3 equiv), and benzaldehyde (1.2 equiv) in a DMSO solvent at 110 °C to get the desired product (Table 1, entry 1). However, the reaction did not result in the formation of the product; instead, a complex TLC was observed. Changing the solvent to isopropyl alcohol also did not result in product formation (Table 1, entry 2). When N2H4·H2O was replaced with NaBH4 in an isopropyl alcohol solvent, the desired product was formed with a 25% conversion of the starting material to the product. Doubling the number of equivalents of NaBH4 resulted in a slight increase in the yield of the reaction (Table 1, entry 4). The reaction was also performed with a stoichiometric and excess amount of Cu(OAc)2, but the yield was not improved. Under the basicmedium, in the presence of KOtBu, the reaction gave only 30% conversion to the product (Table 1, entry 5). Changes in the number of equivalents of KOtBu or Cu(OAc)2 or the addition of other metal catalysts did not improve the results (Table 1, entries 6-10). In the presence of only a copper catalyst, the reaction did not yield the product (Table 1, entry 11). Changing the solvent to DMSO or DMA and adding NH4Cl instead of KOtBu led to the formation of a small amount of the product (Table 1, entries 12-14). In the presence of Fe powder and NH4Cl in an isopropanol solvent, the reaction produced a higher yield (Table 1, entries 15-17). A solvent system of isopropyl alcohol and water (4:1) gave a good yield in the absence of NH4Cl (Table 1, entries 18-20). The reaction did not give rise to product formation in the absence of Fe powder (Table 1, entry 21). The best yield was observed in the presence of 3 equiv of Fe powder in an isopropanol:-water (4:1) solvent system (Table 1, entry 20). Finally, the reaction was performed with only an isopropanol:water (4:1) solvent system, but a better yield was not observed.",
        "Various other solvents (such as MeOH, EtOH, tBuOH, HFIP, 1,4-dioxane, THF, DMF, DCE, DMAc, acetonitrile, toluene, and xylene) were also screened; however, those solvents did not give rise to a better yield. After having optimized the reaction conditions (Fe powder (3 equiv), aldehydes (1.5 equiv), 2.5 mL of isopropanol, 0.5 mL of H2O, 110 °C), various electronically and sterically varied aldehydes (2a) were reacted with 2-(2-nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1a) to see the substrate diversity of the reaction. A series of quinazolinone-fused heterocycles (3) were obtained smoothly with yields of 58-86% (Scheme 2). Substrates containing electron-donating groups afforded the correspond-ing products (3b and 3c) in 78% and 77% yields, respectively. Substrates containing halogen atoms produced the correspond-ing products (3d-3i) in 68-86% yields.",
        "A highly conjugated polycyclic-ring-containing substrate (3j) was also synthesized; however, the yield of the reaction was much lower (58%). This low yield could be explained by the lower reactivity of the polycyclic, conjugated starting aldehyde (2j). The reaction was further explored for the synthesis of novel bi-aryl electron-donating and electron-withdrawing-group-containing compounds (3k-3m) with yields of 78-85%. Heterocyclic aldehydes (2o and 2p) also reacted smoothly to give the corresponding products (3o and 3p) in 61% and 74% yields, respectively. The reaction was also well-suited for the aliphatic aldehydes and gave the corresponding products (3q and 3t) with 69-74% yields.",
        "Synthesis of Bio-Inspired Molecular Scaffolds. Com-pounds containing derivatives of piperidine,17 morpholine,18 or piperazine19 are prone to show antitubercular activities.19,20 Considering their biological importance, we attempted to synthesize dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-one deriva-tives containing a piperidine, morpholine, or piperazine motif to study their fluorescence properties. Toward this, a series of aldehydes (2a′-2e′) were synthesized and subjected to a reaction with compound 1a. It was found that those aldehydes (2a′-2e′) reacted smoothly with compound 1a, giving the corresponding products (4a-4e) in 65-78% yields (Scheme 3).",
        "To see the applicability of the reaction in gram-scale synthesis, the reaction was carried out with 1.2 g of the starting material under standardized conditions (Scheme 4). It was observed that the reaction went smoothly to give the corresponding product in a 73% yield, which suggests that this is a scalable method for the synthesis of dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones.",
        "To understand the mechanism of the reaction, control experiments were conducted, as shown in Scheme 5. The reaction was conducted in the absence of aldehyde, and it was observed that only the nitro group was reduced to give product 5 (Scheme 5, (i)). This experiment indicates that intermediate 5 is formed during the reaction. However, conversion of the starting material 1a to the intermediate 5 was only 30% after 24 h. The addition of the aldehyde to the reaction mixture resulted in its complete conversion into the product, indicating that the aldehyde is accelerating the reaction rate by reacting with an amine (5), formed in situ, in the reaction medium. Further, the reaction did not give rise to product formation in the absence of H2O, indicating the essential role of water in the reaction medium (Scheme 5, (ii)). When the reaction was performed in the absence of an aldehyde and in the presence of a D2O:isopropanol solvent system, deuterated product 5D was formed (Scheme 5, (iii)), which clearly indicates that, during the reduction process, hydrogen came from water. From that, it can be stated that H2O is used as a source of hydrogen in the reduction process to form intermediate 5 from the starting material 1a. The reaction produced the desired product in good yield in the presence of BTH, proving that it does not proceed via a radical pathway (Scheme 5, (iv)). Therefore, it can be stated that the reaction is going through an electrontransfer mechanism. The reaction resulted in 54% conversion to the product when it was conducted only in water in the absence of 2-propanol (Scheme 5, (v)). This could be explained by the lower solubility of the starting material in water.",
        "Based on the control experiments and earlier literature reports, a mechanism is proposed in Scheme 6. In the first step, the nitro group present in compound 1a is reduced to form an amine intermediate (I) in the presence of Fe powder and water via an electron transfer mechanism. Then this amine intermediate (I) reacts with aldehydes (2a) to form an imine intermediate (II), which undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the desired product (3a).",
        "Photophysical Studies. With the diverse 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones in hand, we turned our attention to the study of the photophysical properties of those synthesized compounds (3j-4e) as shown in Table 2.",
        "Fluorescence emission spectra and UV-vis spectra of the synthesized novel compounds (3j-4e) were measured in DCM at a 5 × 10-6 mol/L concentration. The fluorescence emission spectra of the compounds are presented in Figure 2.",
        "The UV-vis study showed that the absorption band of compounds 3j-4e covers 250-430 nm and consists of two to three absorption peaks, which are ascribed to π-π* and n-π* charge transfer transitions. The compounds (3j-4e) haveshown a blue fluorescence emission with a quantum yield (ΦF) up to 0.72. A bathochromic shift in absorption wavelength was observed for compound 4a. Exceptionally high emission maxima (493 nm) were observed for compound 4a compared to others with a quantum yield (ΦF) of 0.14. Compound 4e has shown the minimum absorption wavelength with a quantum yield (ΦF) of 0.45. The maximum quantum yield (ΦF = 0.72) was observed for compound 3l with an absorption wavelength of 305 nm.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we have developed an efficient and regioselective one-pot protocol for the synthesis of novel biheterocyclic 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones starting from 2-(2-nitrophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one. The reaction proceeded through an iron-powder-mediated, one-pot reductive cyclization process. Mechanistic studies revealed that water was acting as a source of hydrogen for the reduction of the nitro group, which was proven by the deuterium-labeling experiment. In this reaction, the aldehyde had played a significant role, accelerating the reduction process by converting an amine, formed in situ, to the product. The reaction has shown a wide substrate scope with a high yield and a high functional group tolerance. In addition, several bio-inspired molecular scaffolds have also been synthesized. The photophysical properties of the synthesized fused compounds were studied and found to show blue fluorescence emission with a moderate to good fluorescence quantum yield. The outcomes provided here might be of great relevance in the fields of medicinal chemistry and materials science.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Information. All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from commercial suppliers and utilized without additional purification. Silica gel with a mesh size of 100-200 was used for column chromatography purifications. Without additional purification, commercial-grade chemicals and solvents were used. Experiments involving moisture-or air-sensitive chemicals were carried out in oven-dried glassware under positive nitrogen or argon pressure and using freshly distilled solvents. Merck 60 F254 precoated silica gel plates of 0.2 mm thickness were used for analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC). During elution of the column, TLC plates were viewed using UV radiation (254 nm) on a Spectroline model ENF-24061/F 254 nm instrument. Flash chromatography was carried out with the specified solvent system and 60-120 mesh silica gel. Typically, columns were packed as slurry and pre-equilibrated with the appropriate solvent system before use. High-resolution mass spectral analysis (HRMS) was carried out on a Bruker Daltonics MicroTOF-Q-II mass spectrometer using MeOH as a solvent, and an electrospray ionization (ESI) positive method was used. A Bruker 400 NMR spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H, 100 MHz for 13C) was used to record the 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of the synthesized compounds. For 1H NMR spectra, chemical shifts are reported as δ in units of parts per million (ppm) relative to the signal of chloroform-d (δ 7.26, singlet). Multiplicities were given as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), dd (doublet of doublets), dt (doublet of triplets), or m (multiplet). For a given resonance, the number of protons (n) is indicated by nH. Coupling constants (J value) are reported in hertz (Hz). For 13C{1H} NMR spectra, chemical shifts are reported as δ in units of parts per million (ppm) downfield from TMS (δ 0.0) and relative to the signal of chloroform-d (δ 77.0, triplet).",
