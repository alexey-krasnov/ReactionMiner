The difference spectrum of the enzyme-bound intermediate formed during the conversion of EPSP (75 pM) to chorismate catalyzed by chorismate synthase (17 pM) at 25 °C, pH 7.0. The data points are the amplitudes of traces similar to that of Figure lb recorded at various wavelengths. FMNH2 is not known, and there is no consensus with respect to the overall mechanism.12 We report herein EPSP-induced, transient changes in the ab-sorbance spectrum of FMNH2 consistent with the formation of a flavin-C4 adduct, thereby demonstrating for the first time direct involvement of redox-active FMNH2 in the catalytic cycle. Figure la shows a single-turnover experiment in which the absorbance at 400 nm was monitored using a Hi-Tech SF-51 stopped-flow spectrophotometer installed and operated in an anaerobic glovebox as previously described.13 A rapid increase in the absorbance, with a rise time close to the dead time of the apparatus, is followed by a decrease in absorbance that occurs with /cobKj 30 s'1. The final absorbance was that observed when EPSP was omitted from syringe B when no transient absorbance changes were detected. No effects were observed when FMNH2 was omitted or when chorismate synthase was shot against FMNH2 alone. However, when Na2S204 was omitted and the FMNH2 generated photochemically in the presence of EDTA,14 absorbance changes similar to those shown in Figure la were observed. Figure 1 b shows the effect of increasing the EPSP concentration such that ca. 6 catalytic cycles of the enzyme (17 pM) are required for the complete conversion of EPSP to chorismate. The con-centration of the intermediate is now maintained in a quasi steady state for ca. 100 ms before decaying with the same rate constant (*ob«i -30 s’1). The amplitude of the effects shown in parts a and b of Figure 1 depended in a linear manner on the FMNH2 concentration up to a value of 20 jtM with a final chorismate synthase concentration of 17 jiM and a saturating EPSP concentration of 100 juM. At higher FMNH2 concentrations, no further increase occurred (data not shown). This indicates stoichiometric, tight binding (AT < 0.5 /uM) of 1 equiv of FMNH2/39K subunit of chorismate synthase. Maintaining the FMNH2 concentration at 40 /uM, with 17 jtM chorismate synthase, but varying the EPSP concentration from 0 to 50 mM caused the amplitude to increase from 0 to that shown in Figure lb. At EPSP concentrations in the range 50-100 /uM, no further increase occurred. We conclude that the transient increase in absorbance at 400 nm is associated with an inter-mediate form of FMN that is present on the enzyme only when EPSP is being converted to chorismate. We have obtained a difference spectrum (Figure 2) for this FMN species that is not characteristic of free FMN/FMNH2 nor of protein-bound FMN/FMNH2 calculated from the spectra of Klebsiella pneu-moniae flavodoxin in its oxidized and hydroquinone states.15 The essentially 0 amplitude at 580 nm indicates that FMN semi-quinone14 is not formed at detectable levels.

We conclude that the FMNH2 does not simply undergo a one-or two-electron oxidation during the catalytic cycle. The relatively small absorbance change (Ae^ = 1.3 mM\"1 cm-1) associated with the decay of the intermediate could reflect either its low steady-state concentration or its intrinsic spectral characteristics. A charge-transfer complex is a possibility, although we also note the similarity of the difference spectrum of the intermediate to that of the flavin-C4 adduct.16 Since all four cysteinyl thiol groups predicted from the DNA sequence17 were quantitatively detected using 5,5,-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)18 in 8 M urea, we do not consider that the role of FMNH2 is to reduce a disulfide as recently reported for mercuric ion reductase.18 Acknowledgment.

It is therefore difficult to calculate a turnover number under the conditions of the stopped-flow experiments from the steady-state assay data necessarily obtained at a much lower enzyme concentration (ca. 50 nM). Direct Observation of MeRh(CO)2I3~: The Key Intermediate in Rhodium-Catalyzed Methanol Carbonylation Anthony Haynes,13 Brian E. Mann,la David J. Gulliver,16 George E. Morris,16 and Peter M. Maitlis4,la Department of Chemistry, The University Sheffield S3 7HF, England Research and Development Department, BP Chemicals Salt End, Hull HU 12 8DS, England Received July 29, 1991 One of the most important industrial processes utilizing ho-mogeneous transition-metal catalysis is the rhodium and iodide promoted carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid. Extensive research by the Monsanto group2 34and others3,4 indicated that the active catalyst precursor was [Rh(CO)2I2]~, A, and that the re-action proceeded as shown in Scheme I. In this cycle the step which determines the overall rate is the oxidative addition of Mel to Rh(CO)2I2“.5 However, the methyl-rhodium complex, B, was never detected, and the first product observed from a stoichiometric oxidative addition of Mel to A was the acetyl complex C.6 We now report that, when the oxidative addition of Mel to Rh(CO)2I2\" is carried out in neat Mel solvent, the crucial in-termediate MeRh(CO)2I3~, B, can be detected at low concentration using FTIR and FTNMR spectroscopy. The observation of B has also allowed estimation of the rate of the key methyl migration (1) (a) Sheffield University, (b) BP Chemicals, Hull. (2) Dekleva, T. W.; Forster, D. Adv.

(C-C bond-forming) step, B -C.A high steady-state ratio of the concentrations [B]/ [A] will be favored by a high [Mel].7 For other systems it has previously been found that the rate of migration of methyl onto CO can be enhanced by factors of more than 104 *in very polar solvents.8 Thus the use of a less polar solvent such as Mel should also favor detection of B by reducing the rate of the step B -* C.The initial IR bands due to c/s-Rh(CO)2I2~ MCO) 1985 and 2055 cm'1] in a solution of Bu4N[Rh(CO)2I2] in neat Mel9 were slowly replaced by those of the product C [t'(CO) 1740, 2061 cm\"1]. However, careful observation consistently showed the presence of another small band, v(CO) 2104 cm'1, in the region expected for the high-frequency band of B.10,11 During the reaction the 2104-cm'1 absorption decayed in direct proportion to the 1985-cm\"1 band, due to A. It was also shown that the ratio of the absorptions, A2\\M/Am5 = Ra, was directly proportional to [Mel] over the range 12-16 M in dichloromethane at 25 °C. Thus the 2104-cm\"1 absorption behaved exactly as predicted for (7) For the reaction scheme assuming that k.2 is negligible, since the reaction A — C reaches completion, the steady-state approximation for [B] gives the relationships [B] A:,[Mel] , , *,A2[MeI] [A] -+ k2 a\"d fcobs4 + k2 where Acobl4 is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the reaction A — C. (8) See, for example: Mawby, R.; Basolo, F.; Pearson, R. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964, 86, 3994. Butler, I. S.; Basolo, F.; Pearson, R. G. Inorg. Chem. 1967, 6, 2077. (9) WARNING: Both methyl iodide and the rhodium carbonyl complexes are extremely toxic! Special precautions need to be taken in working with them, especially when Mel is used a solvent! (10) A c/i-dicarbonyl structure would be expected to exhibit two v(CO) bands of similar intensity. It is likely that the low-frequency band is hidden by the absorptions of A and C near 2060 cm\"1.11 (11) These data compare well with those reported for the analogous iridium system: MeIr(CO)2I3\" [v(CO) 2049, 2102 cm\"1], Ir(CO)2I2-(1970, 2045 cm'1). Forster, D. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. Lett. 1969, J, 433; Inorg. Chem. 1972, 11, 473. Figure 1. Graph showing the behavior of the IR bands due to species B (2104 cm\"1) and species C (1723 cm'1) in the first 10 min of the reaction of Bu4N[Rh(CO)2I2] (0.1 M) with neat CH3I at 5 °C. Note that the rate of formation of species C and the concentration of species B both reach a maximum after ca. 6 min (indicated by the arrow). The best straight-line fit for the 1723-cm\"1 data between 6 and 10 min is also shown. B by the steady-state approximation.7 The ratio Ra was larger at lower temperatures (Table I). Monitoring the reaction at 5 °C revealed that the 2104-cm\"1 absorption did not attain its maximum intensity until ca. 6 min after mixing (Figure 1). A first-order rate constant of 8.5 ± 0.5 X 10\"3 s\"1 was measured for the appearance of B, corresponding to a ti/2 of ca. 80 s. Thereafter the absorption decays at the same rate as that of A at 1985 cm\"1; the rate of formation of species C does not reach a peak until the 2104-cm'1 band reaches the maximum intensity. This is the expected behavior for a band belonging to B since the predicted dependence is d[C]/df = fc2[B]. This interpretation of the IR data was confirmed by low-tem-perature 13C('H) NMR spectroscopy using 13C-enriched reactants. A solution of Bu4N[Rh(CO)2I2] in 13CH3I12 was made up at -60 °C and transferred to the probe of a Bruker WH400 NMR spectrometer at -50 °C. The only new signals observed on addition of the rhodium salt were those arising from natural abundance 13C in the Bu4N[Rh(CO)2I2]. When the sample was briefly warmed to +20 °C, to allow reaction, and then returned to the -50 °C NMR probe, a new doublet was observed in the rhodium methyl region [6(13C) -0.65 ppm, !./(l03Rh-,3C) = 14.7 Hz] as well as signals due to a small amount of species C.13 With the H decoupler switched off, the rhodium-methyl signal was split into a quartet of doublets, with 17(13C-1H) = 143 Hz, the same as in MeRh(PPh3)2I2.14 A value of 5 2.08 ppm for the 'H resonance of the methyl of B was found indirectly from the ,3C NMR spectrum;15,16 this is again typical of a methyl-rhodium species. The sample was warmed until conversion of A into C was complete, when the doublet at 5 -0.65 could no longer be observed. Similar experiments using ca. 70% 13CO enriched Bu4N[Rh-(CO)2I2] in unenriched Mel enabled assignment of a doublet (5 175.1 ppm, 'y(l03Rh-I3C) = 60 Hz) to the terminal carbonyls of B, suggesting strongly that they are equivalent. Coupling between the methyl and carbonyl 13C signals of B could not be detected in an experiment using 13C-enriched samples of both Rh(CO)2I2~ and Mel. However, only a very small 27(13C-13C) is expected (12) Containing 99% l3C, from Aldrich; 10% (CD3)2CO was added as a lock signal. Separate tests showed that the acetone had no effect.

(15) The 1H chemical shift was determined using off-resonance decoupling at various frequencies,16 since this technique is far faster than two-dimensional 13C-'H correlation for a single 13C group. The ‘H signal could not be detected directly due to its proximity to the intense 13CH3I signal. (16) Archer, R. A.; Cooper, R. D. G.; Demarco, P. V.; Johnson, L. R. F. J. Chem. Soc., Chem.

A combination of kinetic data for the conversion of A to C with estimated values of [B]/[A] has allowed estimation of the rate of methyl migration (fc2). An Arrhenius plot of the data in Table I over the range 5-35 °C yielded a good straight line (correlation coefficient 0.999) and gave activation parameters of AH* = 63 ± 2 kJ mol'1 and AS* = -59 ± 9 J mol'1 K'1 for the crucial methyl migration (carbonylation) step of the catalytic cycle.17 These data show that oxidative addition of Mel to A proceeds normally to give a methyl-rhodium complex B. The large values obtained for k: show that the previous nonobservation of B is due primarily to the rapidity with which it reacts to give species C. High rates of alkyl migration have been reported for other rhodium systems,1 ** much faster than for other unactivated metals in nonpolar solvents.* This is probably the major reason why rhodium is such a good carbonylation catalyst.

We now report the synthesis, structure, and polymerization behavior of the title compound (2). The properties of 2 provide strong support for the proposed two-state propagation mechanism.

The con-centration of the intermediate is now maintained in a quasi steady state for ca. 100 ms before decaying with the same rate constant (*ob«i -30 s’1).",
        "The amplitude of the effects shown in parts a and b of Figure 1 depended in a linear manner on the FMNH2 concentration up to a value of 20 jtM with a final chorismate synthase concentration of 17 jiM and a saturating EPSP concentration of 100 juM. At higher FMNH2 concentrations, no further increase occurred (data not shown). This indicates stoichiometric, tight binding (AT < 0.5 /uM) of 1 equiv of FMNH2/39K subunit of chorismate synthase. Maintaining the FMNH2 concentration at 40 /uM, with 17 jtM chorismate synthase, but varying the EPSP concentration from 0 to 50 mM caused the amplitude to increase from 0 to that shown in Figure lb. At EPSP concentrations in the range 50-100 /uM, no further increase occurred. We conclude that the transient increase in absorbance at 400 nm is associated with an inter-mediate form of FMN that is present on the enzyme only when EPSP is being converted to chorismate. We have obtained a difference spectrum (Figure 2) for this FMN species that is not characteristic of free FMN/FMNH2 nor of protein-bound FMN/FMNH2 calculated from the spectra of Klebsiella pneu-moniae flavodoxin in its oxidized and hydroquinone states.15 The essentially 0 amplitude at 580 nm indicates that FMN semi-quinone14 is not formed at detectable levels.",

        "We conclude that the FMNH2 does not simply undergo a one-or two-electron oxidation during the catalytic cycle. The relatively small absorbance change (Ae^ = 1.3 mM\"1 cm-1) associated with the decay of the intermediate could reflect either its low steady-state concentration or its intrinsic spectral characteristics. A charge-transfer complex is a possibility, although we also note the similarity of the difference spectrum of the intermediate to that of the flavin-C4 adduct.16 Since all four cysteinyl thiol groups predicted from the DNA sequence17 were quantitatively detected using 5,5,-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)18 in 8 M urea, we do not consider that the role of FMNH2 is to reduce a disulfide as recently reported for mercuric ion reductase.18Acknowledgment.

(C-C bond-forming) step, B -C.A high steady-state ratio of the concentrations [B]/ [A] will be favored by a high [Mel].7 For other systems it has previously been found that the rate of migration of methyl onto CO can be enhanced by factors of more than 104 *in very polar solvents.8 Thus the use of a less polar solvent such as Mel should also favor detection of B by reducing the rate of the step B -*C.The initial IR bands due to c/s-Rh(CO)2I2~ MCO) 1985 and 2055 cm'1] in a solution of Bu4N[Rh(CO)2I2] in neat Mel9 were slowly replaced by those of the product C [t'(CO) 1740, 2061 cm\"1]. However, careful observation consistently showed the presence of another small band, v(CO) 2104 cm'1, in the region expected for the high-frequency band of B.10,11 During the reaction the 2104-cm'1 absorption decayed in direct proportion to the 1985-cm\"1 band, due to A. It was also shown that the ratio of the absorptions, A2\\M/Am5 = Ra, was directly proportional to [Mel] over the range 12-16 M in dichloromethane at 25 °C. Thus the 2104-cm\"1 absorption behaved exactly as predicted for(7) For the reaction schemeassuming that k.2 is negligible, since the reaction A — C reaches completion, the steady-state approximation for [B] gives the relationshipswhere Acobl4 is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the reaction A — C.",

It is likely that the low-frequency band is hidden by the absorptions of A and C near 2060 cm\"1.11(11) These data compare well with those reported for the analogous iridium system: MeIr(CO)2I3\" [v(CO) 2049, 2102 cm\"1], Ir(CO)2I2-(1970, 2045 cm'1).

The best straight-line fit for the 1723-cm\"1 data between 6 and 10 min is also shown. B by the steady-state approximation.7 The ratio Ra was larger at lower temperatures (Table I).",
        "Monitoring the reaction at 5 °C revealed that the 2104-cm\"1 absorption did not attain its maximum intensity until ca. 6 min after mixing (Figure 1). A first-order rate constant of 8.5 ± 0.5 X 10\"3 s\"1 was measured for the appearance of B, corresponding to a ti/2 of ca. 80 s. Thereafter the absorption decays at the same rate as that of A at 1985 cm\"1; the rate of formation of species C does not reach a peak until the 2104-cm'1 band reaches the maximum intensity. This is the expected behavior for a band belonging to B since the predicted dependence is d[C]/df = fc2[B].",
        "This interpretation of the IR data was confirmed by low-tem-perature 13C('H) NMR spectroscopy using 13C-enriched reactants. A solution of Bu4N[Rh(CO)2I2] in 13CH3I12 was made up at -60 °C and transferred to the probe of a Bruker WH400 NMR spectrometer at -50 °C. The only new signals observed on addition of the rhodium salt were those arising from natural abundance 13C in the Bu4N[Rh(CO)2I2]. When the sample was briefly warmed to +20 °C, to allow reaction, and then returned to the -50 °C NMR probe, a new doublet was observed in the rhodium methyl region [6(13C) -0.65 ppm, !./(l03Rh-,3C) = 14.7 Hz] as well as signals due to a small amount of species C.13 With the H decoupler switched off, the rhodium-methyl signal was split into a quartet of doublets, with 17(13C-1H) = 143 Hz, the same as in MeRh(PPh3)2I2.14 A value of 5 2.08 ppm for the 'H resonance of the methyl of B was found indirectly from the ,3C NMR spectrum;15,16 this is again typical of a methyl-rhodium species. The sample was warmed until conversion of A into C was complete, when the doublet at 5 -0.65 could no longer be observed.",
        "Similar experiments using ca. 70% 13CO enriched Bu4N[Rh-(CO)2I2] in unenriched Mel enabled assignment of a doublet (5 175.1 ppm, 'y(l03Rh-I3C) = 60 Hz) to the terminal carbonyls of B, suggesting strongly that they are equivalent. Coupling between the methyl and carbonyl 13C signals of B could not be detected in an experiment using 13C-enriched samples of both Rh(CO)2I2~ and Mel. However, only a very small 27(13C-13C) is expected(12) Containing 99% l3C, from Aldrich; 10% (CD3)2CO was added as a lock signal. Separate tests showed that the acetone had no effect.",
