Bowden, Jeremy D. Erickson, R. Morris Bullock,* and Ba L. Tran* Abstract: Mechanistic studies of substrate insertion into dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene) complexes with two bridging hydrides have been shown to require dimer dissociation to generate transient, highly reactive (NHC)CuNone H monomers in solution. Using single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) transfor-mations, we discovered a new pathway of stepwise insertion of CO2 into [(NHC)CuH]2 without complete dissociation of the dimer. The first CO2 insertion into dimeric [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (IPr*OMe=N,N’-bis(2,6-bis(diphenylmethyl)-4-methoxy-phenyl)imidazole-2-ylidene) produced a dicopper formate hydride [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-H). A second CO2 in-sertion produced a dicopper bis(formate), [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-1,1-O2CH), containing two different bonding modes of the bridging formate. These dicopper formate complexes are inaccessible from solution reactions since the dicopper core cleanly ruptures to monomeric complexes when dissolved in a solvent. Introduction The reaction of a gas and a solid organometallic complex in a single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) transformation provides a crucial link between homogeneous and heteroge-neous catalysis.[1] These SC-SC transformations are rare and unpredictable since small molecular changes from chemical reactions can have a detrimental effect on the crystal packing and conservation of crystallinity.[2] The rigidity of the crystal lattice in SC-SC transformations can attenuate side reactions and dissociation of weakly bound ligands, enabling structural characterization of fleeting intermediates and selective transformations that cannot be readily ob-served in solution.[1b,c,3] Catalytic reduction of CO2 has attracted intense interest for sustainable chemical production,[4] and Cu-mediated transformations of CO2 are known for homogeneous [5] and heterogeneous systems.[4b,c,6] Copper complexes have been reported for the hydrogenation,[5a,d–f] hydroboration,[7] and hydrosilylation[8] of CO2. Despite being recognized as a key fundamental step mediated by CuNone H complexes,[5c,9] clusters,[10] and nanoparticles,[4c] the mechanism of CO2 insertion into CuNone H bonds remains ambiguous. The rapid rate at which CO2 inserts into the class of dimeric complexes of [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC= IPr, 6Dipp, 7Dipp) [11] in solution to form the corresponding monomeric, two-coordinate (NHC)Cu-(k1-O2CH) formate complexes [8a,12] has impeded systematic mechanistic study. Nevertheless, the insertion of CO2 into transient monomeric CuNone H species supported by N-heterocyclic and cyclic alkyl amino carbene ligands has been invoked (Scheme 1A).[5a,7a] The rapid formation of (NHC)Cu(k1-O2CH) is inconsistent with the rate of sub-strate insertion in the rate-limiting regime of CuNone H mono-merization from dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 based on kinetic studies.[13] It is conceivable that a small, linear CO2 molecule could insert into the [Cu2H2] core of [(NHC)CuH]2 without requiring complete dimer dissociation to form transient CuNone H monomers (Scheme 1B). Insertions of CO2 into metal hydride bonds in photochemical[14] and thermal reactions without necessitat-ing formation of mononuclear metal hydrides have been reported.

Insertions of unsaturated substrates into metal hydride dimers without generation of discrete hydride monomers have been experimentally observed or theoretically pro-posed. Specifically, insertions of nitriles or α-olefins into the bridging hydride of bimetallic complexes of Rh,[17] Fe,[18] Ca,[19] and Mg[20] to produce the corresponding bridging imido-hydride[17b,18] and bridging alkyl-hydride complexes[19c,20] have been reported. Based on DFT calcu-lations, the insertion of 1-hexene into the [Mg2H2] core of bimetallic [(nacnac)MgH]2 in solution to produce [(nacnac)Mg]2(μ-hexyl)](μ-H) has a lower net energy barrier than the insertion of 1-hexene into monomeric (nacnac)MgNone H to produce (nacnac)Mg-hexyl.[20,21] The di-magnesium hexyl-hydride species is proposed to rapidly dissociate in solution into monomeric (nacnac)Mg-hexyl and (nacnac)MgNone H, which dimerizes to give [(nacnac)MgH]2. [20] Analogous to the dimagnesium hexyl-hydride, solvent can destabilize plausible intermediates of CO2 insertion into [(NHC)CuH]2, thereby precluding structural and spectro-scopic characterization. Therefore, the detection of such unstable intermediates would necessitate the elimination of solvent. Sadighi and co-workers have structurally character-ized the cationic complex of {[(IPr)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)} +,[12a] but we are unaware of neutral dicopper formate intermedi-ates from the reactions of [(NHC)CuH]2 and CO2. We report here the SC-SC transformations for the stepwise insertion of CO2 gas into [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (1) to produce the corresponding [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-H) (2) and [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-1,1-O2CH) (3) (Scheme 1, Figure 1). The isolation and reactivity of these dicopper formate species provide important mechanistic implications that improve our understanding of the insertion of CO2 into copper-hydride dimers. Results and Discussion Selection of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 for SC-SC transformations To identify candidates for SC-SC reactions, we considered reported single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) structures of [(NHC)CuH]2 complexes (NHC= IPr*Et IPr* tBu, IPr*OMe, 6Dipp, 7Dipp).[22,13] Orange single crystals of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (1) were reliably produced from vapor diffusion of pentane into a THF solution of 1 at 25 °C, and proved suitable for SC-SC reactions. The crystal lattice of 1 contains co-crystallized THF, yet the crystals are robust. SCXRD analysis of 1 after heating at 100 °C for 24 h or under dynamic vacuum for 16 h at 25 °C did not alter the quality of the single crystals or remove the co-crystallized THF molecule from the lattice. The thermal stability of the single crystals of 1 is in stark contrast to the thermal instability of 1 in solution, for which decomposition was observed at 50 °C. In the absence of moisture and air, the crystallinity of 1 is retained over many weeks when stored under a rigorously maintained N2 atmosphere. For spectroscopic studies, the copper deuteride isotopologue, [(IPr*OMe)CuD]2 (1D), was prepared in 87% isolated yield from the reaction of (IPr*OMe)CuCl, NaOtAm and (EtO)3SiD. The isotopic purity of 1D is indicated by the absence of a hydride signal at 3.92 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum, with all other resonances remaining unchanged.[23] SCXRD analysis of multiple independent crystals of 1 and 1D shows no statisti-cally significant differences (Figure S4).[24,25] The role of solvent on product identity from SC-SC and solution reactions of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 and CO2 Exposure of orange single crystals of 1 to CO2 (0.5 or 1.0 atm) produced colorless crystals in approximately 15 mi-nutes (Scheme 2). The lower pressure of 0.5 atm of CO2 yielded more crystals that remained X-ray quality compared to experiments using 1 atm of CO2. The time required to observe the color change was not significantly altered for the two different pressures. Application of vacuum after the addition of CO2 did not adversely affect the single-crystal quality. The SCXRD determination of the resulting color-less crystals revealed the formation of [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)(μ-H) (2), as shown in Figure 1, providing unequiv-ocal evidence for the insertion of one equivalent of CO2 into the [CuH]2 core. This binding mode of the formate ligand has been observed for {[(IPr)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)} + [12a] and Cu clusters supported by polydentate phosphine ligands,[16a,b] and has been proposed as an intermediate in heteroge-neously catalyzed reduction of CO2. [16c] The distance be-tween the Cu centers of 2.3592(8) Å in 1 has significantly increased to 2.6180(8) Å in 2. We anticipated that the remaining bridging hydride ligand of 2 could insert CO2 since stepwise insertions of CO2 into L[Fe3(μ-H)3], [15a, 26] and of olefins into [(nacnac)CaH]2, [19c] have been reported.[27] Exposing single crystals of 1 to CO2 (1 atm) for 3 h produced (IPr*OMe)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)(1,1-μ-O2CH) (3) (Figure 1), revealing two different formate binding modes. The 1,3-μ-O2CH mode is common compared to that of 1,1-μ-O2CH in bridging formate complexes.[18,28] The presence of both binding modes of formates has been structurally character-ized for several late metal complexes.[29] In contrast to these different formate binding modes in 3, CO2 insertions into L[Fe3(μ-H)3] exclusively produced LFe3(1,1-μ-O2CH)3. [15a] Interestingly, computational analysis on the first CO2 insertion into L[Fe3(μ-H)3] to form L[Fe3(μ-H)2(1,1-μ-O2CH)] suggests the reaction proceeds by initial formation of a 1,3-μ-O2CH ligand followed by rearrangement to a 1,1-μ-O2CH ligand with a computed energy barrier of 8.5 kcalmolNone 1. The calculated ground-state structures of L[Fe3(μ-H)2(1,3-μ-O2CH)] and L[Fe3(μ-H)2(1,1-μ-O2CH)] differ in energy by less than 1 kcalmolNone 1.[30] The unexpected observation of two distinct binding modes of formate suggests considerable change of the dicopper core after the first CO2 insertion. DFT calculations on CO2 insertion into a Cu2(μ-H) core supported by a truncated polydentate phosphine ligand found that the ground-state structure of Cu2(μ-1,3-O2CH) is preferred over that of Cu2(μ-1,1-O2CH). [16b] Alternatively, the different binding mode may result from packing effects of the crystal lattice, in which steric environment can only accommodate formate ligands of mixed binding for the second insertion of CO2. The double insertion of CO2 into [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 1 to produce bis(formate) complex 3 results in significant structural change as the distance between copper centers is elongated by 1.11 Å, from 2.36 Å in 1 to 3.47 Å in 3. However, the volumes of the crystal unit cells increased by only 2.3%.[1b] Analysis of the void space of 1 using an estimated probe radius of 1.7 Å for CO2 did not show sufficient space in the crystal lattice to readily accommodate CO2 [31] (Figure S5). This result suggests a complex pathway by which CO2 diffuses within the crystalline lattice towards the [Cu2H2] core for reaction. Structural comparisons of 2 and 3 reveal prominent differences (Figure 1). The μ-1,3-O2CH ligand in 2 adopts a delocalized bridging geometry, with the Cu1None O1/Cu2None O2 bond lengths differing by only 0.030 Å. In contrast, the difference in Cu1None O1 and Cu2None O2 distances in 3 is 0.214 Å. Together with the shortened Cu1-O1 and Cu2None O3 distances of 1.982(2) Å and 1.933(2) Å, respectively, and the much less bent O3None Cu2None C2 angle of 160.4° (cf. O3None Cu1None C1 at 136.8°), considerable asymmetry is observed. The average Cu-carbene bond length of 3 (1.877 Å) is also shorter than in 2 (1.945 Å), which may stem from significant electronic changes at Cu between the two complexes. We examined the bulk samples of 3 by IR spectroscopy to analyze the stretching frequencies of the two different binding modes of the formate ligands.[32] Unfortunately, the broad, overlapping signals from the IPr*OMe ligand obscured the identification of the CNone H and CNone O regions corresponding to μ-1,1 and μ-1,3 formates (Figure S10). Nevertheless, we observed bands at 1628 and 1302 cmNone 1 in the expected range for the corresponding CNone O asymmetric and symmetric vibration modes of a formate ligand.[32] Although the CNone H region of 3 was not resolved, the isotopologue, 3D, revealed stretches at 2108 and 2090 cmNone 1 consistent with reported CNone D stretching frequencies for O2CD ligands, [32] supporting different formate ligand envi-ronments. The CNone O asymmetric and symmetric stretches could not be identified in 3D as they were obscured by the bands from IPr*OMe. We also investigated the effect of solvent on the stability and nuclearity of the bridging dicopper formate complexes. While the SC-SC reactions of CO2 and [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (1) retained the dicopper structure, solvent ruptures the dicopper core of 2 and 3. Dissolution of 2 in C6D6 at 25 °C generates (IPr*OMe)CuO2CH (4) and 1 (Scheme 2A, Fig-ure S6), while dissolution of 3 produced only 4 (Scheme 2B). We have independently prepared 4 by addition of CO2 (1 atm) to a bright orange C6D6 solution of 1. In less than one minute, a colorless solution was observed, and the product 4 was verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 2C). The formate ligand of 4 is evidenced by signals at 8.90 ppm and 167.9 ppm in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively, and by SCXRD analysis (Figure 1). These divergent products highlight the striking differences for the reactions of CO2 and [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 in the solid–gas reaction compared to solution phase. Stepwise CO2 insertion into bulk sample of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 To address whether the results obtained by SCXRD analysis of the SC-SC reactions are representative of the bulk sample, we performed powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies on time-dependent reactions of a single batch of 1 to produce 2, followed by 3. Specifically, colorless single crystals of 2 were obtained by subjecting 1 to 0.5 atm of CO2 for 15 min, and exclusive formation of 3 was observed after treatment with 1 atm of CO2 for 5 h. The PXRD patterns of gently ground powders of the resulting single crystals of 1, 2, and 3 are in excellent agreement with the those calculated from the SCXRD data (Figure 2, Figure S38–S40), with minimal differences observed across low and high angle regions. Though the overall structural perturbation between each complex is minimal, sufficient differences are observed in the PXRD patterns, allowing each structure to be distinguished, particularly in the region of 2Θ values between 9° and 11° (Figure 2). In addition to the PXRD analysis of the SC-SC reactions, tandem solution 1H NMR spectroscopy and PXRD studies were conducted to determine the qualitative rate of formation of 2 and 3. The time-dependent experi-ments were performed by exposing the same bulk sample of single crystals of 1 to CO2 (1 atm) at 30 min intervals, followed by PXRD and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis at each time increment. By 1H NMR spectroscopy, the reaction progress was determined by quantifying the ratio of 1 and 4 over time by dissolving the solid samples in C6D6 (Fig-ure S43). Separately, the PXRD measurements of each sample were modelled using a Rietveld fit, in which relative quantities of 2 and 3 were refined to obtain the best agreement between the calculated and experimental pat-terns (Figure S42 and S43). Solution 1H NMR spectroscopy and PXRD analyses further support our conclusion of stepwise insertion, in which the first and second insertion of CO2 is completed in 15 min and 2.5 h, respectively. Analo-gous to the SC-SC reactions, microcrystalline powders of 1 underwent a solid–gas reaction with CO2. Exposing a pulverized powder sample of 1 to 0.5 atm of CO2 at 25 °C for 15 min produced 2, as evidenced by the observation of 1 and [(IPr*OMe)CuO2CH (4) in C6D6 by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These results from the combination of SCXRD and PXRD studies on the SC-SC reactions strongly support the stepwise insertion of CO2 into the [Cu2H2] core. CO2 insertion into the [Cu2H2] core of [(6Dipp)CuH]2 Having established that single crystals or crystalline powder of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 can undergo insertion of CO2 in solid– gas reactions, we also investigated related dimeric copper hydride complexes. We examined [(6Dipp)CuH]2 [12b] be-cause of its similar steric properties to the commonly used [(IPr)CuH]2 with the advantage of higher solution stability to facilitate crystal growth.[8a,12a] Subjecting yellow block crystals of [(6Dipp)CuH]2 (5) to CO2 (1 atm) at 25 °C produced faint yellow crystals in less than 5 min (Sche-me 3A). Immediate SCXRD measurement verified the formation of complex [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-H) (6). Degradation of the single crystals after CO2 exposure produced SCXRD data suitable only for determining structural connectivity of 6 (Figure S17). Analogous to the speciation of 2 in solution, we expect the dissolution of 6 to produce (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) and [(6Dipp)CuH]2 (Scheme 3A). Indeed, the 1H NMR spec-trum of 6 in THF-d8 at 25 °C produced [(6Dipp)CuH]2 (5) and (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8), as verified by resonances at 0.76 and 8.48 ppm, respectively, in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig-ure S18). 1H NMR spectroscopic characterization of (6Dipp)CuO2CH is consistent with that reported. [12b] Longer exposure of crystalline (6Dipp)CuH]2 (5) to 1 atm CO2 at 25 °C for >3 h generated [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-1,1-O2CH) (7) (Scheme 3B), which is tentatively assigned based on the structural precedent of 3. Loss of crystallinity prevented SCXRD analysis, and we cannot definitively rule out [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)2. The double insertion of CO2 into 5 is supported by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopic analysis. The dissolution of crystalline 7 in d8-THF shows only (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Sche-me 3B, Figure S21), which is consistent with the exclusive formation of 4 from bis(formate) 3 in solution.[12b] The IR spectrum of 7 shows two strong stretches at 2787 and 2690 cmNone 1 corresponding to the CNone H modes, and four strong stretching bands at 1655, 1646, 1630, and 1623 cmNone 1 assigned to the asymmetric CNone O stretching modes of the bridging formate ligands.[32] To validate that these stretches are those of the bridging formate ligands, we prepared the isotopologue [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CD)(μ-1,1-O2CD) (7-D) by exposing 5-D [(6Dipp)CuD]2 to 1 atm of CO2 for 3 h. The IR spectrum of 7-D shows the expected shift to lower energies for the CNone D stretches at 2086 and 1997 cmNone 1, and asymmetric CNone O stretches at 1642, 1634, 1620, and 1614 cmNone 1 (Figure S22).[32] In contrast, the IR spectrum of (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) shows a single strong absorption at 1624 cmNone 1 for the asymmetric CNone O stretch of the formate ligand (Figure S16).[32,33] A summary of the IR data of 7, 7-D, and 8 is provided in the Supporting Information. Decarboxylation studies of dicopper formate hydride, dicopper bis(formate), and monomeric copper formate The decarboxylation of dicopper complexes containing bridging μ-1,3 formate(s) to release CO2 and regenerate CuNone H species has been observed in a stoichiometric reaction[34] and proposed in the Cu-catalyzed dehydrogen-ation of formic acid.[35] Therefore, we examined the decar-boxylation of dicopper formate-hydride and dicopper bis-(formate) supported by IPr*OMe and 6Dipp ligands (Scheme 4A, B). Crystalline samples of formate hydride complex 2 and bis(formate) complex 3 were placed under dynamic vacuum for up to 4 days, but showed no increase in 1 by 1H NMR spectroscopy in C6D6. These results provide no evidence for extrusion of CO2. Heating of solids 2 and 3 at 100 °C for 3 h under vacuum gave trace conversion to unidentified products based on 1H NMR spectroscopy in C6D6. In stark contrast, formate hydride complex 6, supported by the 6Dipp ligand, underwent decarboxylation under mild conditions (Scheme 4A). Colorless crystalline samples of 6 that had been stored in an open system under N2 at room temperature overnight became yellow, characteristic of [(6Dipp)CuH]2. 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of the sample before and after standing in an open vial under N2(g) shows an increase in 5 relative to terminal formate monomer 8, indicating the extrusion of CO2. We further investigated the effect of a closed system and vacuum on the role of CO2 on reaction equilibrium and product distribution. A sealed vial of solid 6 under N2(g) also turns yellow, but the product distribution in THF-d8 remains unchanged, as indicated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. This observation indicates that the extruded CO2 is in equilibrium with respect to reinsertion into 5. Over time CO2 inserts into the remaining CuNone H bond of another equivalent of 6 to yield more of the thermodynamically stable bis(formate) 7, which does not undergo decarboxylation, as indicated by independent control studies. The conversion of 6 to 5 occurs more rapidly when samples of 6 are placed under dynamic vacuum to remove CO2, driving this process to completion (Figure S33). Decarboxylation was not observed for solid samples of (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) or (IPr*OMe)CuO2CH (4) (Sche-me 4C) under dynamic vacuum for 12 h[12b] or heated at 100 °C under dynamic vacuum for 20 h (Figures S36 and S37). Dicopper formate hydride 6 has exhibited new reactivity of decarboxylation that has not been observed for monomeric (NHC)copper formate and dicopper bis-(formate) counterparts. Currently, we do not fully under-stand the role of NHC or bridging ligands for this trans-formation; qualitatively these results suggest the key orientation of two copper centers in close proximity for decarboxylation and a strong dependence on supporting ligand.[34] Implications on the reaction mechanism of [(NHC)CuH]2 and CO2 The observations of CO2 insertion into [Cu2H2] cores with-out requiring complete dimer dissociation and that dicopper formate species readily dissociate upon dissolution offer mechanistic implications on the insertion reactions of CO2 for this class of [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC= IPr*OMe, 6Dipp) complexes. First, the faster rate of formation of formate hydride 2 compared to that of bis(formate) 3 may be more related to the rapid solution reaction of CO2 and [(NHC)CuH]2 to form (NHC)CuO2CH. Specifically, 3 requires hours for complete formation in the solid state, whereas 2 is formed in less than 15 min, which is consistent with the rapid reactions of CO2 and [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC= IPr*OMe, 6Dipp, 7Dipp) in solution.[12b] Second, the facile rupture of [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)(μ-H) (2) into 4 and [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 in solution suggests that the first CO2 insertion into [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 forms an unstable formate hydride dicopper (2) that bypasses the monomer-dimer equilibrium of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2, which typically governs the rate of substrate insertion. In the presence of excess CO2, the resulting (IPr*OMe)CuH monomer, from the rupture of 2, can rapidly insert CO2 to form the second equivalent of 4 (Scheme 5). Alternatively, the (IPr*OMe)CuH monomer can dimerize to [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 and proceed in an iterative process of CO2 insertion, rupture of 2, and dimerization to ultimately produce the second equivalent of 4. The high reactivity of transient (NHC)CuNone H monomers towards aldehydes and ketones likely favors the insertion of excess CO2 into a (NHC)CuNone H monomer over dimerization to regenerate [(NHC)CuH]2 (Scheme 5). [13] Conclusion SC-SC reactions of gaseous CO2 and solid [(NHC)CuH]2 have enabled the isolation of rare dicopper formate hydride and dicopper bis(formate) complexes by stepwise CO2 insertion into bridging CuNone H bonds of [(NHC)CuH]2 complexes. These dicopper intermediates are synthetically inaccessible by solution reactions of [(NHC)CuH]2 and CO2 because solvent ruptures the dicopper core into the corre-sponding monomeric constituents. The rapid formation of a dicopper formate hydride species from CO2 insertion into a dimeric [Cu2H2] core of [(NHC)CuH]2 by SC-SC reaction implies that a similar pathway is potentially operational in solution rather than requiring the formation of transient CuNone H monomers from the complete dissociation of CuNone H dimers. These observa-tions provide experimental support of alternative insertion pathways of unsaturated substrates into metal hydride dimers without the conventionally invoked formation of a discrete monomeric metal hydride. Additionally, the iso-lation of dicopper formate complexes has allowed for systematic studies on the effect of nuclearity, bridging ligands, and NHC ligands on decarboxylation. The new reactivity of decarboxylation from a dicopper formate hydride is distinct from stable dicopper bis(formate) and monomeric formate complexes. Lastly, the elimination of solvent and the synthetic control conferred by SC-SC reactions, which may not be accessible from solution chemistry, can potentially uncover new reactivity, mechanism, and intermediates for a range of complexes with bridging hydrides, providing an opportunity for fundamental studies at the confluence of heterogeneous, homogeneous, and gas phase chemistry.

        "CO2 Reduction Hot Paper",
        "Single-Crystal to Single-Crystal Transformations: Stepwise CO2 Insertions into Bridging Hydrides of [(NHC)CuH]2 ComplexesAbstract: Mechanistic studies of substrate insertion into dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene) complexes with two bridging hydrides have been shown to require dimer dissociation to generate transient, highly reactive (NHC)CuNone H monomers in solution. Using single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) transfor-mations, we discovered a new pathway of stepwise insertion of CO2 into [(NHC)CuH]2 without complete dissociation of the dimer. The first CO2 insertion into dimeric [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (IPr*OMe=N,N’-bis(2,6-bis(diphenylmethyl)-4-methoxy-phenyl)imidazole-2-ylidene) produced a dicopper formate hydride [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-H). A second CO2 in-sertion produced a dicopper bis(formate), [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-1,1-O2CH), containing two different bonding modes of the bridging formate. These dicopper formate complexes are inaccessible from solution reactions since the dicopper core cleanly ruptures to monomeric complexes when dissolved in a solvent.",
        "The reaction of a gas and a solid organometallic complex in a single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) transformation provides a crucial link between homogeneous and heteroge-neous catalysis.[1] These SC-SC transformations are rare and unpredictable since small molecular changes from chemical reactions can have a detrimental effect on the crystal packing and conservation of crystallinity.[2] The rigidity of the crystal lattice in SC-SC transformations can attenuate side reactions and dissociation of weakly bound ligands, enabling structural characterization of fleeting intermediates and selective transformations that cannot be readily ob-served in solution.[1b,c,3]Catalytic reduction of CO2 has attracted intense interest for sustainable chemical production,[4] and Cu-mediated transformations of CO2 are known for homogeneous [5] and heterogeneous systems.[4b,c,6] Copper complexes have been reported for the hydrogenation,[5a,d–f] hydroboration,[7] and hydrosilylation[8] of CO2. Despite being recognized as a key fundamental step mediated by CuNone H complexes,[5c,9] clusters,[10] and nanoparticles,[4c] the mechanism of CO2 insertion into CuNone H bonds remains ambiguous. The rapid rate at which CO2 inserts into the class of dimeric complexes of [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC= IPr, 6Dipp, 7Dipp) [11] in solution to form the corresponding monomeric, two-coordinate (NHC)Cu-(k1-O2CH) formate complexes [8a,12] has impeded systematic mechanistic study. Nevertheless, the insertion of CO2 into transient monomeric CuNone H species supported by N-heterocyclic and cyclic alkyl amino carbene ligands has been invoked (Scheme 1A).[5a,7a] The rapid formation of (NHC)Cu(k1-O2CH) is inconsistent with the rate of sub-strate insertion in the rate-limiting regime of CuNone H mono-merization from dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 based on kinetic studies.[13] It is conceivable that a small, linear CO2 molecule could insert into the [Cu2H2] core of [(NHC)CuH]2 without requiring complete dimer dissociation to form transient CuNone H monomers (Scheme 1B).",
        "Insertions of CO2 into metal hydride bonds in photochemical[14] and thermal reactions without necessitat-ing formation of mononuclear metal hydrides have been reported. L[M3(μ-H)3] (M=Fe II, CoII, ZnII; L= trianionic tris(β-diketiminate) cyclophane)[15] and CunHn (n=3–8)Dr. R. M. Bullock, Dr. B. L.

        "supported by polydentate phosphine ligands have been shown to insert CO2 into bridging hydrides to produce bridging formates.[16] The tethered tris(β-diketiminate) cyclo-phane ligand disfavors dissociation of the clusters to generate transient MNone H monomers, in contrast to the [(NHC)CuH]2 dimers that rely on their bridging hydride ligands for stability.",
        "Insertions of unsaturated substrates into metal hydride dimers without generation of discrete hydride monomers have been experimentally observed or theoretically pro-posed. Specifically, insertions of nitriles or α-olefins into the bridging hydride of bimetallic complexes of Rh,[17] Fe,[18] Ca,[19] and Mg[20] to produce the corresponding bridging imido-hydride[17b,18] and bridging alkyl-hydride complexes[19c,20] have been reported. Based on DFT calcu-lations, the insertion of 1-hexene into the [Mg2H2] core of bimetallic [(nacnac)MgH]2 in solution to produce [(nacnac)Mg]2(μ-hexyl)](μ-H) has a lower net energy barrier than the insertion of 1-hexene into monomeric (nacnac)MgNone H to produce (nacnac)Mg-hexyl.[20,21] The di-magnesium hexyl-hydride species is proposed to rapidly dissociate in solution into monomeric (nacnac)Mg-hexyl and (nacnac)MgNone H, which dimerizes to give [(nacnac)MgH]2. [20]Analogous to the dimagnesium hexyl-hydride, solvent can destabilize plausible intermediates of CO2 insertion into [(NHC)CuH]2, thereby precluding structural and spectro-scopic characterization. Therefore, the detection of such unstable intermediates would necessitate the elimination of solvent. Sadighi and co-workers have structurally character-ized the cationic complex of {[(IPr)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)} +,[12a] but we are unaware of neutral dicopper formate intermedi-ates from the reactions of [(NHC)CuH]2 and CO2. We report here the SC-SC transformations for the stepwise insertion of CO2 gas into [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (1) to produce the corresponding [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-H) (2) and [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-1,1-O2CH) (3) (Scheme 1, Figure 1). The isolation and reactivity of these dicopper formate species provide important mechanistic implications that improve our understanding of the insertion of CO2 into copper-hydride dimers.",
        "Selection of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 for SC-SC transformationsTo identify candidates for SC-SC reactions, we considered reported single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) structures of [(NHC)CuH]2 complexes (NHC= IPr*Et IPr* tBu, IPr*OMe, 6Dipp, 7Dipp).[22,13] Orange single crystals of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (1) were reliably produced from vapor diffusion of pentane into a THF solution of 1 at 25 °C, and proved suitable for SC-SC reactions. The crystal lattice of 1 contains co-crystallized THF, yet the crystals are robust. SCXRD analysis of 1 after heating at 100 °C for 24 h or under dynamic vacuum for 16 h at 25 °C did not alter the quality of the single crystals or remove the co-crystallized THF molecule from the lattice. The thermal stability of the single crystals of 1 is in stark contrast to the thermal instability of 1 in solution, for which decomposition was observed at 50 °C.",
        "In the absence of moisture and air, the crystallinity of 1 is retained over many weeks when stored under a rigorously maintained N2 atmosphere. For spectroscopic studies, the copper deuteride isotopologue, [(IPr*OMe)CuD]2 (1D), was prepared in 87% isolated yield from the reaction of (IPr*OMe)CuCl, NaOtAm and (EtO)3SiD. The isotopic purity of 1D is indicated by the absence of a hydride signal at 3.92 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum, with all other resonances remaining unchanged.[23] SCXRD analysis of multiple independent crystals of 1 and 1D shows no statisti-cally significant differences (Figure S4).[24,25]The role of solvent on product identity from SC-SC and solution reactions of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 and CO2Exposure of orange single crystals of 1 to CO2 (0.5 or 1.0 atm) produced colorless crystals in approximately 15 mi-nutes (Scheme 2). The lower pressure of 0.5 atm of CO2 yielded more crystals that remained X-ray quality compared to experiments using 1 atm of CO2. The time required to observe the color change was not significantly altered for the two different pressures. Application of vacuum after the addition of CO2 did not adversely affect the single-crystal quality. The SCXRD determination of the resulting color-less crystals revealed the formation of [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)(μ-H) (2), as shown in Figure 1, providing unequiv-ocal evidence for the insertion of one equivalent of CO2 into the [CuH]2 core. This binding mode of the formate ligand has been observed for {[(IPr)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)} + [12a] and Cu clusters supported by polydentate phosphine ligands,[16a,b] and has been proposed as an intermediate in heteroge-neously catalyzed reduction of CO2. [16c] The distance be-tween the Cu centers of 2.3592(8) Å in 1 has significantly increased to 2.6180(8) Å in 2.",
        "We anticipated that the remaining bridging hydride ligand of 2 could insert CO2 since stepwise insertions of CO2 into L[Fe3(μ-H)3], [15a, 26] and of olefins into [(nacnac)CaH]2, [19c] have been reported.[27] Exposing single crystals of 1 to CO2 (1 atm) for 3 h produced (IPr*OMe)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)(1,1-μ-O2CH) (3) (Figure 1), revealing two different formate binding modes. The 1,3-μ-O2CH mode is common compared to that of 1,1-μ-O2CH in bridging formate complexes.[18,28] The presence of both binding modes of formates has been structurally character-ized for several late metal complexes.[29] In contrast to these different formate binding modes in 3, CO2 insertions into L[Fe3(μ-H)3] exclusively produced LFe3(1,1-μ-O2CH)3. [15a] Interestingly, computational analysis on the first CO2 insertion into L[Fe3(μ-H)3] to form L[Fe3(μ-H)2(1,1-μ-O2CH)] suggests the reaction proceeds by initial formation of a 1,3-μ-O2CH ligand followed by rearrangement to a 1,1-μ-O2CH ligand with a computed energy barrier of 8.5 kcalmolNone 1. The calculated ground-state structures of L[Fe3(μ-H)2(1,3-μ-O2CH)] and L[Fe3(μ-H)2(1,1-μ-O2CH)] differ in energy by less than 1 kcalmolNone 1.[30]The unexpected observation of two distinct binding modes of formate suggests considerable change of the dicopper core after the first CO2 insertion. DFT calculations on CO2 insertion into a Cu2(μ-H) core supported by a truncated polydentate phosphine ligand found that the ground-state structure of Cu2(μ-1,3-O2CH) is preferred over that of Cu2(μ-1,1-O2CH). [16b] Alternatively, the different binding mode may result from packing effects of the crystal lattice, in which steric environment can only accommodate formate ligands of mixed binding for the second insertion of CO2. The double insertion of CO2 into [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 1 to produce bis(formate) complex 3 results in significant structural change as the distance between copper centers is elongated by 1.11 Å, from 2.36 Å in 1 to 3.47 Å in 3. However, the volumes of the crystal unit cells increased by only 2.3%.[1b] Analysis of the void space of 1 using an estimated probe radius of 1.7 Å for CO2 did not show sufficient space in the crystal lattice to readily accommodate CO2 [31] (Figure S5). This result suggests a complex pathway by which CO2 diffuses within the crystalline lattice towards the [Cu2H2] core for reaction.",
        "Structural comparisons of 2 and 3 reveal prominent differences (Figure 1). The μ-1,3-O2CH ligand in 2 adopts a delocalized bridging geometry, with the Cu1None O1/Cu2None O2 bond lengths differing by only 0.030 Å. In contrast, the difference in Cu1None O1 and Cu2None O2 distances in 3 is 0.214 Å. Together with the shortened Cu1-O1 and Cu2None O3 distances of 1.982(2) Å and 1.933(2) Å, respectively, and the much less bent O3None Cu2None C2 angle of 160.4° (cf. O3None Cu1None C1 at 136.8°), considerable asymmetry is observed. The average Cu-carbene bond length of 3 (1.877 Å) is also shorter than in 2 (1.945 Å), which may stem from significant electronic changes at Cu between the two complexes.",
        "We examined the bulk samples of 3 by IR spectroscopy to analyze the stretching frequencies of the two different binding modes of the formate ligands.[32] Unfortunately, the broad, overlapping signals from the IPr*OMe ligand obscured the identification of the CNone H and CNone O regions corresponding to μ-1,1 and μ-1,3 formates (Figure S10). Nevertheless, we observed bands at 1628 and 1302 cmNone 1 in the expected range for the corresponding CNone O asymmetric and symmetric vibration modes of a formate ligand.[32] Although the CNone H region of 3 was not resolved, the isotopologue, 3D, revealed stretches at 2108 and 2090 cmNone 1 consistent with reported CNone D stretching frequencies for O2CD ligands, [32] supporting different formate ligand envi-ronments. The CNone O asymmetric and symmetric stretches could not be identified in 3D as they were obscured by the bands from IPr*OMe.",
        "We also investigated the effect of solvent on the stability and nuclearity of the bridging dicopper formate complexes. While the SC-SC reactions of CO2 and [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (1) retained the dicopper structure, solvent ruptures the dicopper core of 2 and 3. Dissolution of 2 in C6D6 at 25 °C generates (IPr*OMe)CuO2CH (4) and 1 (Scheme 2A, Fig-ure S6), while dissolution of 3 produced only 4 (Scheme 2B). We have independently prepared 4 by addition of CO2(1 atm) to a bright orange C6D6 solution of 1. In less than one minute, a colorless solution was observed, and the product 4 was verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 2C). The formate ligand of 4 is evidenced by signals at 8.90 ppm and 167.9 ppm in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively, and by SCXRD analysis (Figure 1). These divergent products highlight the striking differences for the reactions of CO2 and [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 in the solid–gas reaction compared to solution phase.",
        "Stepwise CO2 insertion into bulk sample of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2To address whether the results obtained by SCXRD analysis of the SC-SC reactions are representative of the bulk sample, we performed powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies on time-dependent reactions of a single batch of 1 to produce 2, followed by 3. Specifically, colorless single crystals of 2 were obtained by subjecting 1 to 0.5 atm of CO2 for 15 min, and exclusive formation of 3 was observed after treatment with 1 atm of CO2 for 5 h. The PXRD patterns of gently ground powders of the resulting single crystals of 1, 2, and 3 are in excellent agreement with the those calculated from the SCXRD data (Figure 2, Figure S38–S40), with minimal differences observed across low and high angle regions. Though the overall structural perturbation between each complex is minimal, sufficient differences are observed in the PXRD patterns, allowing each structure to be distinguished, particularly in the region of 2Θ values between 9° and 11° (Figure 2).",
        "In addition to the PXRD analysis of the SC-SC reactions, tandem solution 1H NMR spectroscopy and PXRD studies were conducted to determine the qualitative rate of formation of 2 and 3. The time-dependent experi-ments were performed by exposing the same bulk sample of single crystals of 1 to CO2 (1 atm) at 30 min intervals, followed by PXRD and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis at each time increment. By 1H NMR spectroscopy, the reaction progress was determined by quantifying the ratio of 1 and 4 over time by dissolving the solid samples in C6D6 (Fig-ure S43). Separately, the PXRD measurements of each sample were modelled using a Rietveld fit, in which relative quantities of 2 and 3 were refined to obtain the best agreement between the calculated and experimental pat-terns (Figure S42 and S43). Solution 1H NMR spectroscopy and PXRD analyses further support our conclusion of stepwise insertion, in which the first and second insertion of CO2 is completed in 15 min and 2.5 h, respectively. Analo-gous to the SC-SC reactions, microcrystalline powders of 1 underwent a solid–gas reaction with CO2. Exposing a pulverized powder sample of 1 to 0.5 atm of CO2 at 25 °C for 15 min produced 2, as evidenced by the observation of 1 and [(IPr*OMe)CuO2CH (4) in C6D6 by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These results from the combination of SCXRD and PXRD studies on the SC-SC reactions strongly support the stepwise insertion of CO2 into the [Cu2H2] core.",
        "CO2 insertion into the [Cu2H2] core of [(6Dipp)CuH]2Having established that single crystals or crystalline powder of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 can undergo insertion of CO2 in solid– gas reactions, we also investigated related dimeric copper hydride complexes. We examined [(6Dipp)CuH]2 [12b] be-cause of its similar steric properties to the commonly used [(IPr)CuH]2 with the advantage of higher solution stability to facilitate crystal growth.[8a,12a] Subjecting yellow block crystals of [(6Dipp)CuH]2 (5) to CO2 (1 atm) at 25 °C produced faint yellow crystals in less than 5 min (Sche-me 3A). Immediate SCXRD measurement verified the formation of complex [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-H) (6). Degradation of the single crystals after CO2 exposure produced SCXRD data suitable only for determining structural connectivity of 6 (Figure S17).",
        "Analogous to the speciation of 2 in solution, we expect the dissolution of 6 to produce (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) and [(6Dipp)CuH]2 (Scheme 3A). Indeed, the 1H NMR spec-trum of 6 in THF-d8 at 25 °C produced [(6Dipp)CuH]2 (5) and (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8), as verified by resonances at 0.76 and 8.48 ppm, respectively, in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig-ure S18). 1H NMR spectroscopic characterization of (6Dipp)CuO2CH is consistent with that reported. [12b] Longer exposure of crystalline (6Dipp)CuH]2 (5) to 1 atm CO2 at25 °C for >3 h generated [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)(μ-1,1-O2CH) (7) (Scheme 3B), which is tentatively assigned based on the structural precedent of 3. Loss of crystallinity prevented SCXRD analysis, and we cannot definitively rule out [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CH)2. The double insertion of CO2 into 5 is supported by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopic analysis. The dissolution of crystalline 7 in d8-THF shows only (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Sche-me 3B, Figure S21), which is consistent with the exclusive formation of 4 from bis(formate) 3 in solution.[12b]The IR spectrum of 7 shows two strong stretches at 2787 and 2690 cmNone 1 corresponding to the CNone H modes, and four strong stretching bands at 1655, 1646, 1630, and 1623 cmNone 1 assigned to the asymmetric CNone O stretching modes of the bridging formate ligands.[32] To validate that these stretches are those of the bridging formate ligands, we prepared the isotopologue [(6Dipp)Cu]2(μ-1,3-O2CD)(μ-1,1-O2CD) (7-D) by exposing 5-D [(6Dipp)CuD]2 to 1 atm of CO2 for 3 h. The IR spectrum of 7-D shows the expected shift to lower energies for the CNone D stretches at 2086 and 1997 cmNone 1, and asymmetric CNone O stretches at 1642, 1634, 1620, and 1614 cmNone 1 (Figure S22).[32] In contrast, the IR spectrum of (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) shows a single strong absorption at 1624 cmNone 1 for the asymmetric CNone O stretch of the formate ligand (Figure S16).[32,33] A summary of the IR data of 7, 7-D, and 8 is provided in the Supporting Information.",
        "Decarboxylation studies of dicopper formate hydride, dicopper bis(formate), and monomeric copper formateThe decarboxylation of dicopper complexes containing bridging μ-1,3 formate(s) to release CO2 and regenerate CuNone H species has been observed in a stoichiometric reaction[34] and proposed in the Cu-catalyzed dehydrogen-ation of formic acid.[35] Therefore, we examined the decar-boxylation of dicopper formate-hydride and dicopper bis-(formate) supported by IPr*OMe and 6Dipp ligands (Scheme 4A, B). Crystalline samples of formate hydride complex 2 and bis(formate) complex 3 were placed under dynamic vacuum for up to 4 days, but showed no increase in 1 by 1H NMR spectroscopy in C6D6. These results provide no evidence for extrusion of CO2. Heating of solids 2 and 3 at 100 °C for 3 h under vacuum gave trace conversion to unidentified products based on 1H NMR spectroscopy in C6D6.",
        "In stark contrast, formate hydride complex 6, supported by the 6Dipp ligand, underwent decarboxylation under mild conditions (Scheme 4A). Colorless crystalline samples of 6 that had been stored in an open system under N2 at room temperature overnight became yellow, characteristic of [(6Dipp)CuH]2. 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of the sample before and after standing in an open vial under N2(g) shows an increase in 5 relative to terminal formate monomer 8, indicating the extrusion of CO2.",
        "We further investigated the effect of a closed system and vacuum on the role of CO2 on reaction equilibrium and product distribution. A sealed vial of solid 6 under N2(g) also turns yellow, but the product distribution in THF-d8 remains unchanged, as indicated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. This observation indicates that the extruded CO2 is in equilibrium with respect to reinsertion into 5. Over time CO2 inserts into the remaining CuNone H bond of another equivalent of 6 to yield more of the thermodynamically stable bis(formate) 7, which does not undergo decarboxylation, as indicated by independent control studies. The conversion of 6 to 5 occurs more rapidly when samples of 6 are placed under dynamic vacuum to remove CO2, driving this process to completion (Figure S33).",
        "Decarboxylation was not observed for solid samples of (6Dipp)CuO2CH (8) or (IPr*OMe)CuO2CH (4) (Sche-me 4C) under dynamic vacuum for 12 h[12b] or heated at 100 °C under dynamic vacuum for 20 h (Figures S36 and S37). Dicopper formate hydride 6 has exhibited new reactivity of decarboxylation that has not been observed for monomeric (NHC)copper formate and dicopper bis-(formate) counterparts. Currently, we do not fully under-stand the role of NHC or bridging ligands for this trans-formation; qualitatively these results suggest the key orientation of two copper centers in close proximity for decarboxylation and a strong dependence on supporting ligand.[34]Implications on the reaction mechanism of [(NHC)CuH]2 and CO2The observations of CO2 insertion into [Cu2H2] cores with-out requiring complete dimer dissociation and that dicopperformate species readily dissociate upon dissolution offer mechanistic implications on the insertion reactions of CO2 for this class of [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC= IPr*OMe, 6Dipp) complexes. First, the faster rate of formation of formate hydride 2 compared to that of bis(formate) 3 may be more related to the rapid solution reaction of CO2 and [(NHC)CuH]2 to form (NHC)CuO2CH. Specifically, 3 requires hours for complete formation in the solid state, whereas 2 is formed in less than 15 min, which is consistent with the rapid reactions of CO2 and [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC= IPr*OMe, 6Dipp, 7Dipp) in solution.[12b]Second, the facile rupture of [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(1,3-μ-O2CH)(μ-H) (2) into 4 and [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 in solution suggests that the first CO2 insertion into [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 forms an unstable formate hydride dicopper (2) that bypasses the monomer-dimer equilibrium of [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2, which typically governs the rate of substrate insertion. In the presence of excess CO2, the resulting (IPr*OMe)CuH monomer, from the rupture of 2, can rapidly insert CO2 to form the second equivalent of 4 (Scheme 5). Alternatively, the (IPr*OMe)CuH monomer can dimerize to [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 and proceed in an iterative process of CO2 insertion, rupture of 2, and dimerization to ultimately produce the second equivalent of 4. The high reactivity of transient (NHC)CuNone H monomers towards aldehydes and ketones likely favors the insertion of excess CO2 into a (NHC)CuNone H monomer over dimerization to regenerate [(NHC)CuH]2 (Scheme 5). [13]SC-SC reactions of gaseous CO2 and solid [(NHC)CuH]2 have enabled the isolation of rare dicopper formate hydride and dicopper bis(formate) complexes by stepwise CO2 insertion into bridging CuNone H bonds of [(NHC)CuH]2 complexes. These dicopper intermediates are synthetically inaccessible by solution reactions of [(NHC)CuH]2 and CO2 because solvent ruptures the dicopper core into the corre-sponding monomeric constituents.",
        "The rapid formation of a dicopper formate hydride species from CO2 insertion into a dimeric [Cu2H2] core of [(NHC)CuH]2 by SC-SC reaction implies that a similar pathway is potentially operational in solution rather than requiring the formation of transient CuNone H monomers from the complete dissociation of CuNone H dimers. These observa-tions provide experimental support of alternative insertion pathways of unsaturated substrates into metal hydride dimers without the conventionally invoked formation of a discrete monomeric metal hydride. Additionally, the iso-lation of dicopper formate complexes has allowed for systematic studies on the effect of nuclearity, bridging ligands, and NHC ligands on decarboxylation. The new reactivity of decarboxylation from a dicopper formate hydride is distinct from stable dicopper bis(formate) and monomeric formate complexes.",
        "Lastly, the elimination of solvent and the synthetic control conferred by SC-SC reactions, which may not be accessible from solution chemistry, can potentially uncover new reactivity, mechanism, and intermediates for a range of complexes with bridging hydrides, providing an opportunity for fundamental studies at the confluence of heterogeneous, homogeneous, and gas phase chemistry.",
