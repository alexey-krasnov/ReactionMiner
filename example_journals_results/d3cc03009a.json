Crimmin * Reaction of a molecular calcium hydride with a series of group 9 dicarbonyl complexes [M(g5-C5Me5)(CO)2] (M = Co, Rh, Ir) led to the formation of both mono(formyl) and bis(formyl) complexes. The bis(formyl) complexes are unique. They have been characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and examples have been crystal-lographically characterised for the first time. Metal bis(formyl) complexes are exceedingly rare. Only a handful of examples have been documented.1 The first metal bis(formyl) complex I was reported in 1979 from reaction of [Re(Z5-C5H5) NO(CO)2][BF4] with two equiv. of LiBHEt3 (Fig. 1). 2–4 This species was reported to decompose over two hours at room temperature.2 In 2010, the reaction of a pendant Lewis acid supported rhenium complex [Re(Ph2P(CH2)2B(C8H14))2(CO)4] with two equiv. of NaHBEt3 was described, the rhenium bis(formyl) complex II was identified as a reaction intermediate at None40 1C (Fig. 1).5 Interest in metal bis(formyl) complexes stems from their potential relevance in the homologation and hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO),6–9 key reactions underpinning the Fischer–Tropsch process.10–23 For example, II was shown to evolve into a C–C coupled product, which may derive from an intramolecular reaction of the ligands.24 Similarly, based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, III, a bimetallic calcium complex with formyl ligands bridging two calcium sites, has been proposed as an intermediate in ethene diolate formation from reaction of [Ca(m-H)(Me4TACD)]2[BAr4]2] with CO (Me4TACD = 1,4,7,10-tetramethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane; Ar = 3,5-Me2 C6H3). 25 We recently reported the reactions of a molecular magne-sium hydride with a range of metal carbonyl complexes (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir), giving a series of mono(formyl) complexes.20 Herein we describe the reactions of a molecular calcium hydride (1)26,27 with a series of Group 9 carbonyl complexes [M(Z5-C5Me5)(CO)2] (M = Co, Rh, Ir). 28 By altering the reaction conditions both mono(formyl) (2) and bis(formyl) (3) hetero-metallic complexes could be generated. These new species have been characterised by standard spectroscopic techniques and their electronic structure investigated using DFT methods. The reaction of 1 with [M(Z5-C5Me5)(CO)2] (M = Co, Rh, Ir) in C6D6 solution led to the formation of two products 2-M and 3-M (Scheme 1). Taking M = Co as an example, 2-Co and 3-Co were formed in a 3 : 2 ratio after one hour at 25 1C. Repeating the reaction using 1NoneTHF in place of 1 improved selectivity for 2-Co. Ultimately allowing its isolation in 72% from recrystallisation from n-hexane solution. Isolated samples of 2-Co are remark-ably stable and C6D6 solutions can be heated to 60 1C for a week with little or no loss of the mono(formyl) complex. Neverthe-less, re-exposing 2-Co to the reaction conditions does not lead Chem. Commun.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023to clean formation of 3-Co. The formation of mono(formyl) and bis(formyl) complexes is presumed to occur by stepwise hydro-metallation of the carbonyl ligands. DFT calculations are con-sistent with these steps being exergonic. Similar reactions between 1NoneTHF and [Rh(Z5-C5Me5)(CO)2] or [Ir(Z5-C5Me5)(CO)2] led to formation of 2-Rh-THF and 2-Ir-THF respectively. 1H NMR spectroscopic data supports the retention of a single equivalent of THF in the complex, likely bound to one of the calcium centres. Bis(formyl) complexes 3-Rh and 3-Ir were again observed as side-products in these reactions. These species are less stable than 3-Co and could not be easily separated from unreacted starting material and by-products. Nevertheless, for M = Rh and Ir, crystals of 3-Rh and 3-Ir formed on multiple occasions, allowing unambiguous confirmation of the bis(formyl) complex as the minor product (Fig. 2). Mono(formyl) complexes 2-Co, 2-Rh-THF and 2-Ir-THF were characterised by diagnostic resonances at d = 13.50–13.96 ppm and d = 247.0–298.9 ppm in the 1H and 13C NMR respectively, assigned to the formyl group. Further coupling was apparent for 2-Rh-THF, 2JRh–H = 1.7 Hz and 1JRh–C = 105.4 Hz. Infrared data reveal stretches in the region n = 1813–1838 cmNone1 for 2-Co, 2-Rh-THF and 2-Ir-THF, assigned to the isocarbonyl CRO stretches. For 2-Ir-THF, a stretch at n = 1658 cmNone1 was observed, assigned to the formyl CQO stretch. For 2-Co and 2-Rh-THF, the formyl CQO stretch is likely obscured by the CQN stretch from the b-diketiminate ligand.20 Similarly, bis (formyl) complexes 3-Co, 3-Rh and 3-Ir exhibited resonances at d = 13.50–14.98 ppm and d = 203.0–298.5 ppm in the 1H and 13C NMR respectively, assigned to two magnetically equivalent formyl groups. In the solid-state, 2-Co comprises a near planar tetrametallic array comprised of two Co and two Ca sites bridged by formyl and carbonyl ligands (Fig. 2). The calcium centres are five-coordinate with approximate trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The formyl ligands are located between the two calcium atoms and adopt an anti-configuration. It is likely that this parent structure is retained in solution. The observation of a single set of b-diketiminate ligand and formyl resonances for 2-Co, 2-Rh-THF and 2-Ir-THF would be consistent with retention of a time-average highly symmetric tetrametallic structure in which two halves of the molecule are related by an inversion symmetry element. An alternate plausible structure for 2-Rh-THF and 2-Ir-THF could be the monomeric THF adducts. 3-Ir crystallises in the P21/n space group. This is the first structurally characterised bis(formyl) complex reported. The formyl ligands are mutually cis-at the iridium centre. Each oxygen atom is bridged by two calcium centres, manifesting a Ca2O2 four membered ring. In contrast to 2-Co where the bridging formyl groups adopt a k1 coordination to each metal This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Commun.centre, those in 3-Ir appear more side-on and approach Z2 coordination to both calcium sites. The Ca–O bond lengths in 3-Ir are 2.320(5) and 2.359(5) Å compared to 2.336(2) Å in 2-Co. The Ca–C distances range 2.694–2.724(7) Å. The Ir–C and C–O bond lengths are 1.909(7)–1.915(7) and 1.299(8)–1.314(9) Å, respectively. Ir–C–O bond angles are close to 132.0(5)1, approaching the trigonal structure for a {CHO}None moiety. The C–C distance is 2.89(1) Å, well beyond the covalent radii of carbon suggesting no interaction between the carbon atoms. 3-Rh shows a very similar structure in the solid state (see ESI† for details). The electronic structures of 3-Co, 3-Rh and 3-Ir were investi-gated by computational methods. Geometry optimisations were performed with DFT using the oB97X-D29 functional and a hybrid basis set. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO),30 Extended Transition State-Natural Orbital Chemical Valence (ETS-NOCV),31 Quan-tum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM)32 and Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI)33 calculations were performed. NBO calculations revealed a consistent set of highly ionic structures, which can be best formalised as [M(Z5-C5Me5) (CHO)2] 2None dianions coordinated to cationic calcium fragments. Hence, across the series, NPA charges on calcium are high and positive (+1.80 to +1.81), while those on carbon are close to neutral (None0.03 to None0.07). Most of the charge resides on the oxygen atoms (None0.93 to None0.94). The Wiberg Bond Indices (WBI) for the M–C bonds increase down the group taking values of 0.95 o 0.97 o 1.08 for Co o Rh o Ir. The WBIs for the CQO bonds are consistent between 1.27 and 1.31 with no discernible trends down the triad. The M–C values above 1 and CQO values significantly below 2 are consistent with the formyl ligand adopting metallocarbene character. For comparison, the free dianionic complexes [M(Z5-C5Me5)(CHO)2] 2None (30-M) were calcu-lated. For 30-M, NPA charges on carbon (0.17 to 022) and oxygen (–0.74 to –0.76) were more positive than in 3 but followed the same general trends. The close agreement of NBO data between 3 and 30 is consistent with the proposed ionic bonding situa-tion (Fig. 3). QTAIM calculations further support this bonding formula-tion. For 3-Ir, bond paths are identified between each calcium and oxygen atom of the bridging motif. Bond critical points show r(r) and r2r(r) values of 0.04 e BohrNone3 and 0.19–0.22 e BohrNone5 respectively, consistent with binding of the formyl ligand to calcium being primarily through electrostatic interactions. ETS-NOCV calculations were performed on 3-Co, 3-Rh and 3-Ir to investigate the interaction of the formyl moiety with the transition metal centre.34 As described previously by us in a related system,20 the principal contribution (Dr1) to the bond-ing is the s-donation of the HOMO of the {CHO}None ligand to a transition-metal d-orbital (66 to 75% of DEORB). The secondary (Dr2) and tertiary (Dr3) interactions involve p back-donation from a metal-based orbital to the orthogonal p*-orbitals of the {CHO}None ligand and are largely negligible in comparison to Dr1 (9 to 12% of DEORB). Considering a simplified molecular orbital picture of selected donor–acceptor interactions, it becomes clear that both formyl ligands of 3 should be interacting with the same metal d-orbitals (Fig. 4). A consequence of this effect is appar-ent on comparing the electronic structures of 3 with the monomeric unit of 2, labelled 20. The carbonyl ligand is expected to be a better p-acceptor than the formyl and compete for electron-density from the d-orbitals. As such, the back-donation component of the bonding to the mono(formyl) ligand of 20 is expected to be weaker than that to bis(formyl) ligands of 3. The impact of the competition for electron density is apparent in the M–C WBIs to the formyl group which take values of 0.81–0.97 in 20 but 0.94–1.08 in 3. The calculations are consistent with a degree of electronic communication between the two {CHO}None fragments when coordinated to [M(Z5-C5Me5)]. The series of bis(formyl) complexes 3-Co, 3-Rh, and 3-Ir are potentially relevant intermediates in carbon–carbon bond for-mation from CO and hydride ligands. Based on DFT calcula-tions, III has previously been proposed as a potential intermediate in ethene diolate formation through coupling of the two formyl groups bridging the calcium site.25 Monitoring solutions containing 3-Co, 3-Rh, or 3-Ir for extended periods provided no evidence for carbon–carbon bond formation. Like-wise, exposing a sample of 2-Co to an atmosphere of CO Chem. Commun.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023resulted in decomposition products only. Given that calcium bis(formyl) complexes have previously been proposed as inter-mediates in ethene diolate formation, the isolation and appar-ent stability of 3 toward carbon–carbon bond formation is notable.

The Ca–C distances range 2.694–2.724(7) Å. The Ir–C and C–O bond lengths are 1.909(7)–1.915(7) and 1.299(8)–1.314(9) Å, respectively. Ir–C–O bond angles are close to 132.0(5)1, approaching the trigonal structure for a {CHO}None moiety. The C–C distance is 2.89(1) Å, well beyond the covalent radii of carbon suggesting no interaction between the carbon atoms. 3-Rh shows a very similar structure in the solid state (see ESI† for details). The electronic structures of 3-Co, 3-Rh and 3-Ir were investi-gated by computational methods. Geometry optimisations were performed with DFT using the oB97X-D29 functional and a hybrid basis set. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO),30 Extended Transition State-Natural Orbital Chemical Valence (ETS-NOCV),31 Quan-tum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM)32 and Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI)33 calculations were performed. NBO calculations revealed a consistent set of highly ionic structures, which can be best formalised as [M(Z5-C5Me5) (CHO)2] 2None dianions coordinated to cationic calcium fragments. Hence, across the series, NPA charges on calcium are high and positive (+1.80 to +1.81), while those on carbon are close to neutral (None0.03 to None0.07). Most of the charge resides on the oxygen atoms (None0.93 to None0.94). The Wiberg Bond Indices (WBI) for the M–C bonds increase down the group taking values of 0.95 o 0.97 o 1.08 for Co o Rh o Ir. The WBIs for the CQO bonds are consistent between 1.27 and 1.31 with no discernible trends down the triad. The M–C values above 1 and CQO values significantly below 2 are consistent with the formyl ligand adopting metallocarbene character. For comparison, the free dianionic complexes [M(Z5-C5Me5)(CHO)2] 2None (30-M) were calcu-lated. For 30-M, NPA charges on carbon (0.17 to 022) and oxygen (–0.74 to –0.76) were more positive than in 3 but followed the same general trends. The close agreement of NBO data between 3 and 30 is consistent with the proposed ionic bonding situa-tion (Fig. 3). QTAIM calculations further support this bonding formula-tion. For 3-Ir, bond paths are identified between each calciumand oxygen atom of the bridging motif. Bond critical points show r(r) and r2r(r) values of 0.04 e BohrNone3 and 0.19–0.22 e BohrNone5 respectively, consistent with binding of the formyl ligand to calcium being primarily through electrostatic interactions. ETS-NOCV calculations were performed on 3-Co, 3-Rh and 3-Ir to investigate the interaction of the formyl moiety with the transition metal centre.34 As described previously by us in a related system,20 the principal contribution (Dr1) to the bond-ing is the s-donation of the HOMO of the {CHO}None ligand to a transition-metal d-orbital (66 to 75% of DEORB). The secondary (Dr2) and tertiary (Dr3) interactions involve p back-donation from a metal-based orbital to the orthogonal p*-orbitals of the {CHO}None ligand and are largely negligible in comparison to Dr1 (9 to 12% of DEORB). Considering a simplified molecular orbital picture of selected donor–acceptor interactions, it becomes clear that both formyl ligands of 3 should be interacting with the same metal d-orbitals (Fig. 4). A consequence of this effect is appar-ent on comparing the electronic structures of 3 with the monomeric unit of 2, labelled 20. The carbonyl ligand is expected to be a better p-acceptor than the formyl and compete for electron-density from the d-orbitals. As such, the back-donation component of the bonding to the mono(formyl) ligand of 20 is expected to be weaker than that to bis(formyl) ligands of 3. The impact of the competition for electron density is apparent in the M–C WBIs to the formyl group which take values of 0.81–0.97 in 20 but 0.94–1.08 in 3. The calculations are consistent with a degree of electronic communication between the two {CHO}None fragments when coordinated to [M(Z5-C5Me5)]. The series of bis(formyl) complexes 3-Co, 3-Rh, and 3-Ir are potentially relevant intermediates in carbon–carbon bond for-mation from CO and hydride ligands. Based on DFT calcula-tions, III has previously been proposed as a potential intermediate in ethene diolate formation through coupling of the two formyl groups bridging the calcium site.25 Monitoring solutions containing 3-Co, 3-Rh, or 3-Ir for extended periods provided no evidence for carbon–carbon bond formation. Like-wise, exposing a sample of 2-Co to an atmosphere of COChem. Commun.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023resulted in decomposition products only. Given that calcium bis(formyl) complexes have previously been proposed as inter-mediates in ethene diolate formation, the isolation and appar-ent stability of 3 toward carbon–carbon bond formation is notable.
