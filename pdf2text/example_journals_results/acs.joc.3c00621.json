This protocol showed broad substrate scope and afforded moderate-to-excellent yields of both products. It is the first report that the functionalization of quinoxalines occurred regioselectively at the C-8 position of quinoxalines. Mechanistic studies revealed that reaction proceeded via radical pathway.  INTRODUCTION Trifluoromethyled compounds have received a significant amount of attention in medicinal chemistry due to the incorporation of a CF3 group into organic molecules that can significantly enhance their physical, chemical, and biological properties such as membrane permeability, favorable protein-ligand interactions, lipophilicity, bioavailability, and metabolic stability in comparison with their nonfluorinated analogs (Figure 1).1 Over the past decades, various protocols for the preparation of trifluoromethylated organic compounds utilizing numerous trifluoromethylating agents including CF3I, TMSCF3, CF3SO2Na, CF3SO2Cl, Baran’s reagent, Umemoto’s reagent, Togni’s reagent, etc., have been developed.2 In particular, sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate (NaSO2CF3) was reported by Langlois et al. in 1980 and represents one of the cheapest and most a readily available reagents for trifluor-omethylation of organic compounds through radical reaction.3 Among the reported strategies, the direct trifluoromethylation of organic compounds via C-H functionalization reaction is of high interest, due to its high atom economy and no require to prefunctionalization.4 On the other hand, imidazopyridines and quinoxalines are recognized as important class of nitrogen-containing hetero-cycles and found in a wide variety of natural products and pharmaceuticals and materials science. These scaffolds exhibit varied biological activities, such as antitumor, anti-inflamma-tory, antiparasitic, antipyretic, cytotoxic, antiviral, antiulcer, Received: March 22, 2023 antifungal, anti-rhinoviral and anticancer.5 Therefore, synthesis and functionalization of these scaffolds have been paid much attention from the synthetic community.6 Various methods have been developed for the C-H bond functionalization of the C-3 position of the imidazopyridine structures using different substituents such as aryl, alkyl, halogen, thiol, and trifluoromethyl.7 Among these reported methods, direct trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines via trifluoro-methyl radicals have received considerable attention. In 2015, Hajra and co-workers were the first group to report the successful synthesis of 3-trifluoromethylimidazo[1,2-a]-pyridines using Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) as CF3 radical source in the presence of TBHP and AgNO3 at room temperature (Scheme 1a).8 The direct C3-trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives with Ruppert-Prakash reagent (TMSCF3) in the presence of PhI(OAc)2 and CsF in CH3CN was described by Wu et al. in 2019 (Scheme 1b). 9 Very recently, Deng and co-workers disclosed a visible-light-promoted C3-trifluoromethylation of imidazopyridine deriva-tives using tetramethylguanidine trifluoromethyl iodide com-plex (TMG·CF3I) as CF3 radical source in the presence of DBU as base (Scheme 1c).10 Despite such advances, there still remains need for novel and simple synthetic strategies that are facile and effective. In addition, the strategy C-H function-alization of quinoxaline derivatives have remained largely unexplored, and this area of research is still in its infancy. To the best of our knowledge, no examples involving trifluor-omethylation of quinoxaline derivatives have been reported to date. Therefore, the development of new synthetic methods to the functionalization these compounds remains a high-value achievement. Inspired by these studies and our continuing interest in the radical reactions, herein we report regioselective C3-trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and C8-trifluoromethylation of quinoxalines using Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) as CF3 radical source in the presence of MnIII species, which is generated in situ by the KMnO4/AcOH system.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To verify the feasibility of our hypothesis, reaction of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 1a with Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) 2 was selected as the model substrates to optimize the reaction conditions (Table 1). Initially, the reaction of 1a with CF3SO2Na 2 was studied in the presence 3.0 equiv of KMnO4 as oxidant in AcOH as solvent, at the temperature of 80 °C for 2h. To our delight, desired product 3a was obtained in 45% yield (entry 1). Encouraged by this initial result, we examined the effect of various common solvents. Screening of several solvent systems including (DMSO, PhCl, PhCH3, DCE, DMF, CH3CN, EtOAc, and acetone)/AcOH revealed that AcOH/DMSO gives the best result for this reaction (entries 2-9). When the reaction temperature was raised to 100 °C, the desired product 3a was formed in 72% yields (entry 10). In addition, the effect of different AcOH/DMSO ratios on the reaction yield was tested (entries 11 and 12), unfortunately, no results were obtained on the improvement of the product yield. Increasing the usage of KMnO4 to 4.0 equiv led to form product 3a in 59% yield (entry 13). No further improvement of the yield was observed with the increasing reaction time to 4 h (entry 14). As a note, when the model reaction was conducted under N2 atmosphere, the yield of the desired product was not changed (entry 15). The above optimization results suggested that the maximum yield of the desired product 3a (72%) can be obtained under condition of using 3.0 equiv of KMnO4 as the oxidant in AcOH/DMSO as solvent at 100 °C for 2 h. With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, the generality of this method using Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) 2 and variously substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines 1 was investigated and the results are summarized in Table 2. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with electron-donating (OMe), halo-gen (F, Cl, Br), as well as some other electron-withdrawing (CN, NO2) groups on the benzene ring participated in the reaction well to deliver the desired products 3a-3g in 72-87% yields. Subsequently, imidazopyridines bearing substituents on the pyridine rings were also explored. 6-Methyl-2-arylimidazo-[1,2-a]pyridine 2h and 2i react with trifluoromethylating agent to afford the desired products 3h and 3i in 80 and 83% yields, respectively. When Br and Cl were substituted on the C-6 or C-7 position of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, the reaction per-formed well and gave the corresponding products 3j-3q, in 82-90% yields. In addition, we investigated the trifluorome-thylation of 1-methyl-1H-imidazole and 2-arylbenzo[d]-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles under standard reaction conditions. Fortunately, trifluoromethylation of benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]-thiazoles were led to form desired products 3a′ and 3b′ in 83 and 84% yields, respectively. But, 1-methyl-1H-imidazole was not compatible with this transformation, and the correspond-ing products 3c′ were not detected after 6 h. It is noteworthy to mention, to show the diversity of the reaction, we also employed quinoxalines 4 as a coupling partner and studied it to the same reaction conditions. Surprisingly, we observed desired product 5a in 48% yield. Hence, to increase the product yield, we explored different solvent and temperature. A better yield was obtained in AcOH as solvent (please see the optimization table included in the Supporting Information). As depicted in Table 2, a variety of quinoxalines bearing electron-donating, -withdrawing and neutral groups on the phenyl ring were tolerated, allowing the construction of C8-trifluorome-thylated quinoxalines 5a-5i in moderate yields. The structure of 5d also was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray analysis, the ellipsoid probability level is 50%. Additionally, 6,7-dimethyl-2-arylquinoxalines performed smoothly to deliver the desired product 5g-5i in 48-55% yields. To demonstrate the practicability of this approach, we next carried out the gram-scale synthesis of 3a and 5a under the standard conditions and the desired products 3a and 5a were obtained in 68% (357 mg) and 42% (230 mg) yields, respectively (Scheme 2A). To gain insight to the reaction mechanism, a radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) was added to the reaction mixture in varying quantities, and yields of the desired products 3a and 5a were sharply decreased (Scheme 2B). These results suggested that this reaction might involve a radical pathway. On the basis of experimental results above and previous reports,3,11 a plausible reaction mechanism is depicted in Scheme 2C. First, MnIII species are generated from the reaction KMnO4 and AcOH under the thermal condition, which then reacts with the Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) 2 to deliver trifluoromethyl radical A. Sub-sequently, the trifluoromethyl radical is added selectively to C3 of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine/C8 of quinoxalines to give radical intermediate B/D. Then, a single-electron transfer (SET) from intermediate B/D to MnIII leads to release the cation intermediate C/E and simultaneously MnIII reduces into MnII. Probably, both the intermediates B/D and C/E can be stabilized through conjugation with adjacent aryl group. Finally, deprotonation of intermediate C/E affords the desired product 3/5. In summary, we have developed an operationally simple and efficient approach for regioselective trifluoromethylation of imidazopyridines and quinoxalines using Langloi’s reagent as CF3 radical source by KMnO4/AcOH system. The MnIII species is generated in situ from KMnO4/RCOOH system for the formation of trifluoromethyl radicals. A variety of trifluoromethyled imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and quinoxalines with high functional group tolerance were obtained in moderate-to-excellent yields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for the direct C8-trifluoromethylation of quinoxalines. The attractive features of this protocol are the use of inexpensive and readily available materials, short time, and regioselectivity. Further investigations on the detailed mechanism and applications of this method on the other heteroaromatic compounds are currently underway in our laboratory.

        "Mn-Mediated Direct Regioselective C-H Trifluoromethylation of Imidazopyridines and Quinoxalines",
        "ABSTRACT: A simple and highly efficient strategy has been developed for direct C-H trifluoromethylation at C-3 of imidazopyridines and C-8 of quinoxalines with readily available Langlois reagent through KMnO4/AcOH system. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and afforded moderate-to-excellent yields of both products. It is the first report that the functionalization of quinoxalines occurred regioselectively at the C-8 position of quinoxalines. Mechanistic studies revealed that reaction proceeded via radical pathway.",
        "INTRODUCTION Trifluoromethyled compounds have received a significant amount of attention in medicinal chemistry due to the incorporation of a CF3 group into organic molecules that can significantly enhance their physical, chemical, and biological properties such as membrane permeability, favorable protein-ligand interactions, lipophilicity, bioavailability, and metabolic stability in comparison with their nonfluorinated analogs (Figure 1).1 Over the past decades, various protocols for the preparation of trifluoromethylated organic compounds utilizing numerous trifluoromethylating agents including CF3I, TMSCF3, CF3SO2Na, CF3SO2Cl, Baran’s reagent, Umemoto’s reagent, Togni’s reagent, etc., have been developed.2 In particular, sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate (NaSO2CF3) was reported by Langlois et al. in 1980 and represents one of the cheapest and most a readily available reagents for trifluor-omethylation of organic compounds through radical reaction.3 Among the reported strategies, the direct trifluoromethylation of organic compounds via C-H functionalization reaction is of high interest, due to its high atom economy and no require to prefunctionalization.4On the other hand, imidazopyridines and quinoxalines are recognized as important class of nitrogen-containing hetero-cycles and found in a wide variety of natural products and pharmaceuticals and materials science. These scaffolds exhibit varied biological activities, such as antitumor, anti-inflamma-tory, antiparasitic, antipyretic, cytotoxic, antiviral, antiulcer, Received: March 22, 2023antifungal, anti-rhinoviral and anticancer.5 Therefore, synthesis and functionalization of these scaffolds have been paid much attention from the synthetic community.6 Various methods have been developed for the C-H bond functionalization of the C-3 position of the imidazopyridine structures using different substituents such as aryl, alkyl, halogen, thiol, and trifluoromethyl.7 Among these reported methods, direct trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines via trifluoro-methyl radicals have received considerable attention. In 2015, Hajra and co-workers were the first group to report the successful synthesis of 3-trifluoromethylimidazo[1,2-a]-pyridines using Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) as CF3 radical source in the presence of TBHP and AgNO3 at room temperature (Scheme 1a).8 The direct C3-trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives with Ruppert-Prakash reagent (TMSCF3) in the presence of PhI(OAc)2 and CsF in CH3CN was described by Wu et al. in 2019 (Scheme 1b). 9 Very recently, Deng and co-workers disclosed a visible-light-promoted C3-trifluoromethylation of imidazopyridine deriva-tives using tetramethylguanidine trifluoromethyl iodide com-plex (TMG·CF3I) as CF3 radical source in the presence of DBU as base (Scheme 1c).10 Despite such advances, there still remains need for novel and simple synthetic strategies that are facile and effective. In addition, the strategy C-H function-alization of quinoxaline derivatives have remained largely unexplored, and this area of research is still in its infancy. To the best of our knowledge, no examples involving trifluor-omethylation of quinoxaline derivatives have been reported to date. Therefore, the development of new synthetic methods to the functionalization these compounds remains a high-value achievement. Inspired by these studies and our continuing interest in the radical reactions, herein we report regioselective C3-trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and C8-trifluoromethylation of quinoxalines using Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) as CF3 radical source in the presence of MnIII species, which is generated in situ by the KMnO4/AcOH system.",
        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To verify the feasibility of our hypothesis, reaction of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 1a with Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) 2 was selected as the model substrates to optimize the reaction conditions (Table 1). Initially, the reaction of 1a with CF3SO2Na 2 was studied in the presence 3.0 equiv of KMnO4 as oxidant in AcOH as solvent, at the temperature of 80 °C for 2h. To our delight, desired product 3a was obtained in 45% yield (entry 1). Encouraged by this initial result, we examined the effect of various common solvents. Screening of several solvent systems including (DMSO, PhCl, PhCH3, DCE, DMF, CH3CN, EtOAc, and acetone)/AcOH revealed that AcOH/DMSO gives the best result for this reaction (entries 2-9). When the reaction temperature was raised to 100 °C, the desired product 3a was formed in 72% yields (entry 10). In addition, the effect of different AcOH/DMSO ratios on the reaction yield was tested (entries 11 and 12), unfortunately, no results were obtained on the improvement of the product yield. Increasing the usage of KMnO4 to 4.0 equiv led to form product 3a in 59% yield (entry 13). No further improvement of the yield was observed with the increasing reaction time to 4 h (entry 14). As a note, when the model reaction was conducted under N2 atmosphere, the yield of the desired product was not changed (entry 15). The above optimization results suggested that the maximumyield of the desired product 3a (72%) can be obtained under condition of using 3.0 equiv of KMnO4 as the oxidant in AcOH/DMSO as solvent at 100 °C for 2 h.",
        "With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, the generality of this method using Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) 2 and variously substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines 1 was investigated and the results are summarized in Table 2. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with electron-donating (OMe), halo-gen (F, Cl, Br), as well as some other electron-withdrawing (CN, NO2) groups on the benzene ring participated in the reaction well to deliver the desired products 3a-3g in 72-87% yields. Subsequently, imidazopyridines bearing substituents on the pyridine rings were also explored. 6-Methyl-2-arylimidazo-[1,2-a]pyridine 2h and 2i react with trifluoromethylating agent to afford the desired products 3h and 3i in 80 and 83% yields, respectively. When Br and Cl were substituted on the C-6 or C-7 position of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, the reaction per-formed well and gave the corresponding products 3j-3q, in 82-90% yields. In addition, we investigated the trifluorome-thylation of 1-methyl-1H-imidazole and 2-arylbenzo[d]-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles under standard reaction conditions. Fortunately, trifluoromethylation of benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]-thiazoles were led to form desired products 3a′ and 3b′ in 83 and 84% yields, respectively. But, 1-methyl-1H-imidazole was not compatible with this transformation, and the correspond-ing products 3c′ were not detected after 6 h. It is noteworthy to mention, to show the diversity of the reaction, we also employed quinoxalines 4 as a coupling partner and studied it to the same reaction conditions. Surprisingly, we observed desired product 5a in 48% yield. Hence, to increase the product yield, we explored different solvent and temperature. A better yield was obtained in AcOH as solvent (please see the optimization table included in the Supporting Information). As depicted in Table 2, a variety of quinoxalines bearing electron-donating, -withdrawing and neutral groups on the phenyl ring were tolerated, allowing the construction of C8-trifluorome-thylated quinoxalines 5a-5i in moderate yields. The structure of 5d also was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray analysis, theellipsoid probability level is 50%. Additionally, 6,7-dimethyl-2-arylquinoxalines performed smoothly to deliver the desired product 5g-5i in 48-55% yields. To demonstrate the practicability of this approach, we next carried out the gram-scale synthesis of 3a and 5a under the standard conditions and the desired products 3a and 5a were obtained in 68% (357 mg) and 42% (230 mg) yields, respectively (Scheme 2A).",
        "To gain insight to the reaction mechanism, a radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) was added to the reaction mixture in varying quantities, and yields of the desired products 3a and 5a were sharply decreased (Scheme 2B). These results suggested that this reaction might involve a radical pathway. On the basis of experimental results above and previous reports,3,11 a plausible reaction mechanism is depicted in Scheme 2C. First, MnIII species are generated from the reaction KMnO4 and AcOH under the thermal condition, which then reacts with the Langlois’ reagent (NaSO2CF3) 2 to deliver trifluoromethyl radical A. Sub-sequently, the trifluoromethyl radical is added selectively to C3 of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine/C8 of quinoxalines to give radical intermediate B/D. Then, a single-electron transfer (SET) from intermediate B/D to MnIII leads to release the cation intermediate C/E and simultaneously MnIII reduces into MnII. Probably, both the intermediates B/D and C/E can be stabilized through conjugation with adjacent aryl group. Finally, deprotonation of intermediate C/E affords the desired product 3/5.",
        "In summary, we have developed an operationally simple and efficient approach for regioselective trifluoromethylation of imidazopyridines and quinoxalines using Langloi’s reagent as CF3 radical source by KMnO4/AcOH system. The MnIII species is generated in situ from KMnO4/RCOOH system for the formation of trifluoromethyl radicals. A variety of trifluoromethyled imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and quinoxalines with high functional group tolerance were obtained in moderate-to-excellent yields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for the direct C8-trifluoromethylation of quinoxalines. The attractive features of this protocol are the use of inexpensive and readily available materials, short time, and regioselectivity. Further investigations on the detailed mechanism and applications of this method on the other heteroaromatic compounds are currently underway in our laboratory.",
