Recent efforts have mostly focused on understanding the role of defect sites and extraframework Ti. Here, we report the 47/49Ti signature of TS-1 and molecular analogues [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] using novel MAS CryoProbe to enhance the sensitivity. While the dehydrated TS-1 displays chemical shifts similar to those of molecular homologues, confirming the tetrahedral environment of Ti consistent with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it is associated with a distribution of larger quadrupolar coupling constants, indicating an asymmetric environment. Detailed computational studies on cluster models highlights the high sensitivity of the NMR signatures (chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constant) to small local structural changes. These calculations show that, while it will be difficult to distinguish mono-vs dinuclear sites, the sensitivity of the 47/49Ti NMR signature should enable distinguishing the Ti location among specific T site positions. Titanosilicates belong to an important class of heteroge-neous catalysts where Ti is typically incorporated into the crystalline lattice of a zeolite-type framework.1 The discovery of titanosilicalite-1 (TS-1) ca. 40 years ago enabled the development of sustainable processes based on H2O2 as a primary oxidant, leaving H2O as the sole byproduct. 2 Notable industrial examples are the hydroxylation of phenol,3 the epoxidation of propylene,4 and the ammoximation of ketones.5,6 TS-1 has been proposed to contain isolated framework tetrahedral Ti sites, generated by substitution of a small fraction of Si atoms in the zeolite structure.7 Note that the coordination environment of Ti can be dramatically influenced by the preparation method and the state of the catalysts; such sites include partially hydrolyzed octahedral sites,8 pentacoordinated sites,9 tetrahedral titanols,10 and octahedral defect sites.11 Recently, paired Ti sites have been evidenced when TS-1 is reacted with H2O2. 12 The coordination environment in titanosilicates was addressed by direct and indirect characterization methods. The latter relies on using probe molecules such as phosphines13 or pyridine14 as well as reactants, e.g. H2O2, 12 in combination with IR and/or solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. Direct approaches have focused on UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (K and L2,3 edge XANES). 11,15 Even though these techniques can provide information about the extent of Ti incorporation into the framework or the ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral Ti sites, they are limited to averaged local structural information and rely mostly on empirical interpretation. In addition, information on preferential Ti siting at different tetrahedral (T) positions can be obtained from neutron powder diffraction (NPD) analysis, but the interpretation is often complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between Ti sites and silicon vacancies.16-19 47/49Ti ssNMR spectroscopy could be an alternative direct characterization method to access nonaveraged information on the local coordination geometry of Ti.20-22 Titanium possesses two NMR-active nuclei, 47Ti (I = 5/2) and 49Ti (I = 7/2), which are both commonly termed as “unreceptive” due to their low natural abundances (7.44% for 47Ti and 5.41% for 49Ti), moderate quadrupole moments (Q(47Ti) = 29.0 fm2 and Q(49Ti) = 24.0 fm2), and low gyromagnetic ratios (γ(47Ti) = -1.5105 × 107 rad s-1 T-1, γ(49Ti) = -1.51095 × 107 rad s-1 T-1).23 Due to close gyromagnetic ratios, NMR signals from 47Ti and 49Ti usually overlap, which further complicates analysis.24 To date, 47/49Ti ssNMR spectroscopy has been mostly limited to the investigation of bulk materials such as titanium oxides and carbides,25-27 as well as Ti-USY, a favorable zeotype material with only one framework T site, where signal detection was facilitated by high Ti loading (∼20 wt %).21 However, analysis of zeolites with industrially relevant Ti loadings (typically 1.5 wt %) and a multitude of available T sites such as TS-1 have previously not been possible. Yet, the characterization of Ti sites in titanocene chlorides demon-strates the sensitivity of 47/49Ti ssNMR to local structure.24,28 The scope of 47/49Ti ssNMR has been expanded through the development of novel pulse sequences and/or the use of Received: September 15, 2022 Published: July 7, 2023 Communicationpubs.acs.org/JACS © 2023 American Chemical Society 15018 https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c09867 J.

So far, ssNMR spectroscopy of low-γ quadrupolar nuclei such as 47/49Ti remains challenging for samples with low Ti loadings (few wt %) and/or containing Ti with large CQ (e.g., > 15 MHz). Here, we report the 47/49Ti ssNMR signatures of a typical titanosilicate-1 catalyst (1.5 wt % Ti) and their relation to the electronic structure of Ti sites obtained from analysis of related solid-state Ti oxides anatase and rutile and molecular compounds�[Ti(OTBOS)4] (OTBOS = tris(tert-butoxy)-siloxy) and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)]. The measurements were enabled by the recent development of a low-γ solid-state NMR probe with cryogenic cooling of electronic components (CryoProbe with thermally decoupled sample temperature) for a B0 field of 18.8 T, which significantly boosts NMR signal sensitivity under both static and magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions.30 In particular, the use of MAS enables the resolution of 47Ti and 49Ti NMR signals. Comparison of the NMR signatures of Ti in TS-1 and its molecular homologue ([Ti(OTBOS)4]) shows a similar chemical shift, accompanied by a pronounced difference in CQ that originates from the structure enforced by the zeolite framework. The differences indicate more distorted Ti sites in the zeolite framework compared to molecular siloxide compounds. To evaluate the sensitivity of the CryoProbe, ssNMR spectra of anatase TiO2 (60 wt % Ti) were recorded under static (WURST-QCMPG)31 and MAS (DFS-QCPMG-MAS) con-ditions.32,33 The sensitivity per unit time was compared to measurements performed with a low-temperature probe at 14.1 T, available in our laboratory, where the sample rests at ca. 100 K (details are provided in the Supporting Information). The CryoProbe sensitivity enhancement factor was estimated to be 10-15, arising from cryogenic cooling of the RF coil and preamplifier electronics (∼4×), as well as a larger active sample volume (∼3×) owing to longer rotors that the CryoProbe uses.34 The sensitivity gain from the higher field (18.8 T) is roughly compensated for with low-temperature measurements at 14.1 T (100 K). Additionally, the measurement with the CryoProbe at room temperature favors faster relaxation, which allows a further decrease in the measurement time. Note that the gain from signal narrowing and relaxation is sample dependent. Notably, as anatase shows a reasonably small CQ (∼5 MHz), its 47Ti and 49Ti signals can be resolved under MAS. This enables a more facile interpretation of the spectroscopic signature than under static conditions (Figure 1). For rutile, which is associated with larger CQ, a line width up to >0.2 MHz can be recorded without the need for multiple offsets and spectrum reconstruction (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Having obtained encouraging preliminary results, we focused on more challenging materials such as TS-1, with low Ti loading (here, 1.5 wt %). Both static and MAS spectra were recorded with good signal-to-noise ratios in reasonable times (see Figure 1, S/Nstatic = 21, t = 3 days and S/NMAS = 65, t = 1 day) for the dehydrated TS-1 sample, which was chosen in order to facilitate NMR measurements due to the presence of highly symmetric tetrahedral Ti sites evidenced by XAS (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). NMR parameters extracted from the MAS spectra according to the Czjzek model35 show an isotropic chemical shift (δiso) of -910 ppm for 49Ti and a distribution of CQ values with a characteristic value of 7.2 MHz (CQ,max), consistent with an all-oxygen distorted-tetrahedral first coordination sphere (vide inf ra). Notably, no signal is observed in the corresponding hydrated TS-1 sample, likely due to the formation of highly distorted Ti sites with very large CQ values due to hydration: i.e., coordination or reaction with water. This is consistent with pXRD36 and XAS data, the latter showing a sharp decrease of the pre-edge feature specific of tetrahedral sites upon water adsorption (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Given the response of 47/49Ti NMR signatures to subtle changes in coordination environment,24 we next evaluated two tetrahedral molecular complexes. As molecular models for TS-1, [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] were selected, having only oxygens in the first coordination sphere (see the Supporting Information for synthesis and analysis).37,38 According to a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, both molecular models possess near-perfect tetrahedral geometries, as illustrated by their τ4′ values equal to 0.99.38,39 Homoleptic [Ti(OTBOS)4] features four crystallo-graphically identical Ti-OSi bonds (1.785 Å), while in the heteroleptic [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], the Ti-OSi bonds are slightly elongated (1.795 Å) and the Ti-OiPr bond is slightly shortened (1.748 Å). Notably, these compounds, [Ti-(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], show a pre-edge feature in Ti K edge XANES spectra typical for tetrahedral complexes, with position and intensity similar to those for TS-1 (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).40 In terms of NMR signatures, the chemical shifts appear at δiso = -910 ppm for the 49Ti sites in TS-1 to be compared with those at -910 and -880 ppm for [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], respectively. This subtle difference in δiso between the molecular analogues is accompanied by significantly different CQ values of 1.8 MHz for [Ti(OTBOS)4] and 4.0 MHz for [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], consistent with the asymmetry in the Ti-O bond lengths for the heteroleptic complex. Intriguingly, although TS-1 is expected to have a similar Ti coordination according to the XANES and chemical shift alone, the observed CQ,max of TS-1 (7.2 MHz) is significantly larger than that for both molecular models (Figure 2), pointing to distorted Ti sites. To systematically study the origin of the observed changes within the molecular analogues, we computed the NMR parameters for a series of four-coordinated [Ti(OX)4] models (X = OCH3, OSiF3, and OCF3). All compounds show a tetrahedral geometry with different Ti-O-X bond angles, with [Ti(OSiF3)4] displaying more linear bond angles (167°) than [Ti(OCF3)4] (158°) and [Ti(OCH3)4] (153°). Calculated chemical shifts (see the Supporting Information for computa-tional details) for the series are referenced with respect to [Ti(OTBOS)4] (Δδiso = 0 ppm) and show gradual shielding for more electron withdrawing ligands:41 [Ti(OCH3)4] (Δδiso = +31 ppm), [Ti(OSiF3)4] (Δδiso = -24 ppm), and [Ti(OCF3)4] (Δδiso = -106 ppm). The agreement between the experimentally observed (Δδiso = +30 ppm) and the calculated (Δδiso = +18 ppm (calc.)) chemical shifts for [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] in reference to [Ti(OTBOS)4] sub-stantiates the analysis based on model systems. We next traced back the origin of the chemical shift differences using a natural chemical shift (NCS) analysis that allows the determination of the relative magnetic couplings between occupied and vacant orbitals of appropriate symmetries responsible for paramagnetic deshielding.42,43 Here, the dominant couplings arise from the σ(Ti-O) and π(Ti-O) frontier orbitals (Figure 3). Higher ligand electro-negativity leads to shielding, as the energy gap between the filled σ(Ti-O) and the empty π*(Ti-O) is raised (cf. [Ti(OCH3)4] vs [Ti(OCF3)4]). Shielding can also arise from a more linear Ti-O-X arrangement, as higher electron delocalization may stabilize the π(Ti-O) bonds (cf. [Ti-(OCH3)4] vs [Ti(OSiF3)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] vs [Ti(OTBOS)4]). Furthermore, the significantly larger CQ observed for TS-1 (7.2 MHz) compared with [Ti(OTBOS)4] (1.8 MHz) is also notable. Quadrupolar couplings are particularly sensitive to small changes in the coordination environment, namely coordination number and distortion from ideal geometry, hence providing information on the local surrounding of Ti sites in TS-1, making in principle NMR a complementary technique to neutron diffraction studies.16,19 For instance, the structurally similar molecular analogues, [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], show quite different calculated CQ values of 2.3 and 6.3 MHz, respectively, in line with the experimental values, thus demonstrating the sensitivity of CQ to small differences in coordination environment, where a simple substitution of OTBOS by OiPr induces a change in charge distribution, associated with the asymmetry in Ti-O bond lengths. Expanding on the aforementioned information on the molecular analogues, we further evaluate the sensitivity of chemical shift and the quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) for Ti sites constrained within the zeolite framework. Toward this end, we used periodic models where one silicon atom of the MFI structure is substituted by a Ti atom at various T positions and for which the local geometry around the Ti atom was either fixed or allowed to relax. We also investigated models with monomeric and dimeric Ti sites in view of our recent findings (see the Supporting Information for details).12 The NMR parameters of all these Ti sites were then calculated by cutting cluster models terminated by fluorine atoms in order to evaluate the effect of T positions, monomeric and dimeric sites, with and without relaxed structures. Overall, the calculated NMR parameters�chemical shifts and CQ� depend notably on the T site positions and only marginally on having monomeric vs dimeric sites (see Figure S11 in the Supporting Information for further details). Most notable, however, is that the calculated NMR parameters are highly dependent on the underlying periodic model used for the cluster models. While uncertainty of the calculated chemical shift values, obtained from our benchmark calculations, prohibits direct comparison with absolute values observed in experiment, the obtained CQ values span more than 30 MHz as a function of T site and model. Notably, the values dramatically increase for each T site upon geometry optimization due to increased local distortion. At this stage, 47/49Ti NMR is in principle sensitive enough to distinguish between specific T sites due to the sensitivity of the NMR parameters, but would require developing more robust NMR calculation methodologies on realistic periodic models, that include effects related to local vs periodic structural parameters, e.g. unit cell expansion upon Ti substitution, dynamics, and defect sites in zeolite structure as well as extraframework Ti sites to name but a few. In conclusion, we obtained the 47/49Ti ssNMR signatures of TS-1, despite the low Ti loading (<2 wt %). A comparison to molecular model complexes reveals that dehydrated TS-1 shows a distribution of larger quadrupolar coupling constants, which points toward more distorted Ti sites in the TS-1 structure, despite similar XAS signatures between molecular systems and TS-1. Furthermore, the absence of a 47/49Ti NMR signal for the hydrated TS-1 shows that Ti sites in the zeolite framework can adapt even more asymmetric local geometries upon adsorption of molecules (e.g., upon exposure to the atmosphere or under reaction conditions). Overall, this study highlights the feasibility of direct characterization of metal sites without a probe molecule and opens the possibility to investigate other industrially relevant titanosilicate catalysts to address the coordination environment and electronic structure of the respective Ti sites. We are currently working on exploring and developing more advanced computational models and protocols to ascribe observed NMR signatures to Ti sites in different T positions of the MFI framework.

Berkson, Trees De Baerdemaeker, Andrei-Nicolae Parvulescu, Karsten Seidel, J. Henrique Teles, and Christophe Copéret*Cite This: J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 15018-15023 Read OnlineABSTRACT: Although titanosilicalite-1 (TS-1) is among the most successful oxidation catalysts used in industry, its active site structure is still debated. Recent efforts have mostly focused on understanding the role of defect sites and extraframework Ti. Here, we report the 47/49Ti signature of TS-1 and molecular analogues [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] using novel MAS CryoProbe to enhance the sensitivity. While the dehydrated TS-1 displays chemical shifts similar to those of molecular homologues, confirming the tetrahedral environment of Ti consistent with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it is associated with a distribution of larger quadrupolar coupling constants, indicating an asymmetric environment. Detailed computational studies on cluster models highlights the high sensitivity of the NMR signatures (chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constant) to small local structural changes. These calculations show that, while it will be difficult to distinguish mono-vs dinuclear sites, the sensitivity of the 47/49Ti NMR signature should enable distinguishing the Ti location among specific T site positions.",
        "Titanosilicatescatalysts where Ti is typically incorporated into thecrystalline lattice of a zeolite-type framework.1 The discovery of titanosilicalite-1 (TS-1) ca. 40 years ago enabled the development of sustainable processes based on H2O2 as a primary oxidant, leaving H2O as the sole byproduct. 2 Notable industrial examples are the hydroxylation of phenol,3 the epoxidation of propylene,4 and the ammoximation of ketones.5,6 TS-1 has been proposed to contain isolated framework tetrahedral Ti sites, generated by substitution of a small fraction of Si atoms in the zeolite structure.7 Note that the coordination environment of Ti can be dramatically influenced by the preparation method and the state of the catalysts; such sites include partially hydrolyzed octahedral sites,8 pentacoordinated sites,9 tetrahedral titanols,10 and octahedral defect sites.11 Recently, paired Ti sites have been evidenced when TS-1 is reacted with H2O2. 12The coordination environment in titanosilicates was addressed by direct and indirect characterization methods. The latter relies on using probe molecules such as phosphines13 or pyridine14 as well as reactants, e.g. H2O2, 12 in combination with IR and/or solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. Direct approaches have focused on UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (K and L2,3 edge XANES). 11,15 Even though these techniques can provide information about the extent of Ti incorporation into the framework or the ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral Ti sites, they are limited to averaged local structural information and rely mostly on empirical interpretation. In addition, information on preferential Ti siting at different tetrahedral (T) positions can be obtained from neutron powder diffraction (NPD) analysis, but the interpretation is often complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between Ti sites and silicon vacancies.16-1947/49Ti ssNMR spectroscopy could be an alternative direct characterization method to access nonaveraged information on the local coordination geometry of Ti.20-22 Titanium possesses two NMR-active nuclei, 47Ti (I = 5/2) and 49Ti (I = 7/2), which are both commonly termed as “unreceptive” due to their low natural abundances (7.44% for 47Ti and 5.41% for 49Ti), moderate quadrupole moments (Q(47Ti) = 29.0 fm2 and Q(49Ti) = 24.0 fm2), and low gyromagnetic ratios (γ(47Ti) = -1.5105 × 107 rad s-1 T-1, γ(49Ti) = -1.51095 × 107 rad s-1 T-1).23 Due to close gyromagnetic ratios, NMR signals from 47Ti and 49Ti usually overlap, which further complicates analysis.24 To date, 47/49Ti ssNMR spectroscopy has been mostly limited to the investigation of bulk materials such as titanium oxides and carbides,25-27 as well as Ti-USY, a favorable zeotype material with only one framework T site, where signal detection was facilitated by high Ti loading (∼20 wt %).21 However, analysis of zeolites with industrially relevant Ti loadings (typically 1.5 wt %) and a multitude of available T sites such as TS-1 have previously not been possible. Yet, the characterization of Ti sites in titanocene chlorides demon-strates the sensitivity of 47/49Ti ssNMR to local structure.24,28The scope of 47/49Ti ssNMR has been expanded through the development of novel pulse sequences and/or the use of© 2023 American Chemical Societyhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c09867 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 15018-15023dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced NMR spec-troscopy (DNP-SENS),29 which has enabled the detection of Ti surface signals in hydrated TiO2-supported MoO3, albeit necessitating a very high concentration of polarizing agent. So far, ssNMR spectroscopy of low-γ quadrupolar nuclei such as 47/49Ti remains challenging for samples with low Ti loadings (few wt %) and/or containing Ti with large CQ (e.g., > 15 MHz).",
        "Here, we report the 47/49Ti ssNMR signatures of a typical titanosilicate-1 catalyst (1.5 wt % Ti) and their relation to the electronic structure of Ti sites obtained from analysis of related solid-state Ti oxides anatase and rutile and molecular compounds�[Ti(OTBOS)4] (OTBOS = tris(tert-butoxy)-siloxy) and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)]. The measurements were enabled by the recent development of a low-γ solid-state NMR probe with cryogenic cooling of electronic components (CryoProbe with thermally decoupled sample temperature) for a B0 field of 18.8 T, which significantly boosts NMR signal sensitivity under both static and magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions.30 In particular, the use of MAS enables the resolution of 47Ti and 49Ti NMR signals. Comparison of the NMR signatures of Ti in TS-1 and its molecular homologue ([Ti(OTBOS)4]) shows a similar chemical shift, accompanied by a pronounced difference in CQ that originates from the structure enforced by the zeolite framework. The differences indicate more distorted Ti sites in the zeolite framework compared to molecular siloxide compounds.",
        "To evaluate the sensitivity of the CryoProbe, ssNMR spectra of anatase TiO2 (60 wt % Ti) were recorded under static (WURST-QCMPG)31 and MAS (DFS-QCPMG-MAS) con-ditions.32,33 The sensitivity per unit time was compared to measurements performed with a low-temperature probe at 14.1 T, available in our laboratory, where the sample rests at ca. 100 K (details are provided in the Supporting Information). The CryoProbe sensitivity enhancement factor was estimated to be 10-15, arising from cryogenic cooling of the RF coil and preamplifier electronics (∼4×), as well as a larger active sample volume (∼3×) owing to longer rotors that the CryoProbe uses.34 The sensitivity gain from the higher field (18.8 T) is roughly compensated for with low-temperature measurements at 14.1 T (100 K). Additionally, the measurement with the CryoProbe at room temperature favors faster relaxation, which allows a further decrease in the measurement time. Note that the gain from signal narrowing and relaxation is sample dependent. Notably, as anatase shows a reasonably small CQ (∼5 MHz), its 47Ti and 49Ti signals can be resolved under MAS. This enables a more facile interpretation of the spectroscopic signature than under static conditions (Figure 1). For rutile, which is associated with larger CQ, a line width up to >0.2 MHz can be recorded without the need for multiple offsets and spectrum reconstruction (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).",
        "Having obtained encouraging preliminary results, we focused on more challenging materials such as TS-1, with low Ti loading (here, 1.5 wt %). Both static and MAS spectra were recorded with good signal-to-noise ratios in reasonable times (see Figure 1, S/Nstatic = 21, t = 3 days and S/NMAS = 65, t = 1 day) for the dehydrated TS-1 sample, which was chosen in order to facilitate NMR measurements due to the presence of highly symmetric tetrahedral Ti sites evidenced by XAS (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). NMR parameters extracted from the MAS spectra according to the Czjzek model35 show an isotropic chemical shift (δiso) of -910 ppm for 49Ti and a distribution of CQ values with a characteristic value of 7.2 MHz (CQ,max), consistent with an all-oxygen distorted-tetrahedral first coordination sphere (vide inf ra). Notably, no signal is observed in the corresponding hydrated TS-1 sample, likely due to the formation of highly distorted Ti sites with very large CQ values due to hydration: i.e., coordination or reaction with water. This is consistent with pXRD36 and XAS data, the latter showing a sharp decrease of the pre-edge feature specific of tetrahedral sites upon water adsorption (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).",
        "Given the response of 47/49Ti NMR signatures to subtle changes in coordination environment,24 we next evaluated two tetrahedral molecular complexes. As molecular models for TS-1, [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] were selected, having only oxygens in the first coordination sphere (see the Supporting Information for synthesis and analysis).37,38 According to a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, both molecular models possess near-perfect tetrahedral geometries, as illustrated by their τ4′ values equal to 0.99.38,39 Homoleptic [Ti(OTBOS)4] features four crystallo-graphically identical Ti-OSi bonds (1.785 Å), while in the heteroleptic [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], the Ti-OSi bonds are slightly elongated (1.795 Å) and the Ti-OiPr bond is slightly shortened (1.748 Å). Notably, these compounds, [Ti-(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], show a pre-edgefeature in Ti K edge XANES spectra typical for tetrahedral complexes, with position and intensity similar to those for TS-1 (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).40 In terms of NMR signatures, the chemical shifts appear at δiso = -910 ppm for the 49Ti sites in TS-1 to be compared with those at -910 and -880 ppm for [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], respectively. This subtle difference in δiso between the molecular analogues is accompanied by significantly different CQ values of 1.8 MHz for [Ti(OTBOS)4] and 4.0 MHz for [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], consistent with the asymmetry in the Ti-O bond lengths for the heteroleptic complex. Intriguingly, although TS-1 is expected to have a similar Ti coordination according to the XANES and chemical shift alone, the observed CQ,max of TS-1 (7.2 MHz) is significantly larger than that for both molecular models (Figure 2), pointing to distorted Ti sites.",
        "To systematically study the origin of the observed changes within the molecular analogues, we computed the NMR parameters for a series of four-coordinated [Ti(OX)4] models (X = OCH3, OSiF3, and OCF3). All compounds show a tetrahedral geometry with different Ti-O-X bond angles, with [Ti(OSiF3)4] displaying more linear bond angles (167°) than [Ti(OCF3)4] (158°) and [Ti(OCH3)4] (153°). Calculated chemical shifts (see the Supporting Information for computa-tional details) for the series are referenced with respect to [Ti(OTBOS)4] (Δδiso = 0 ppm) and show gradual shielding for more electron withdrawing ligands:41 [Ti(OCH3)4] (Δδiso = +31 ppm), [Ti(OSiF3)4] (Δδiso = -24 ppm), and [Ti(OCF3)4] (Δδiso = -106 ppm). The agreement between the experimentally observed (Δδiso = +30 ppm) and the calculated (Δδiso = +18 ppm (calc.)) chemical shifts for [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] in reference to [Ti(OTBOS)4] sub-stantiates the analysis based on model systems.",
        "We next traced back the origin of the chemical shift differences using a natural chemical shift (NCS) analysis that allows the determination of the relative magnetic couplings between occupied and vacant orbitals of appropriate symmetries responsible for paramagnetic deshielding.42,43 Here, the dominant couplings arise from the σ(Ti-O) and π(Ti-O) frontier orbitals (Figure 3). Higher ligand electro-negativity leads to shielding, as the energy gap between the filled σ(Ti-O) and the empty π*(Ti-O) is raised (cf. [Ti(OCH3)4] vs [Ti(OCF3)4]). Shielding can also arise from a more linear Ti-O-X arrangement, as higher electron delocalization may stabilize the π(Ti-O) bonds (cf. [Ti-(OCH3)4] vs [Ti(OSiF3)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)] vs [Ti(OTBOS)4]).",
        "Furthermore, the significantly larger CQ observed for TS-1 (7.2 MHz) compared with [Ti(OTBOS)4] (1.8 MHz) is also notable. Quadrupolar couplings are particularly sensitive to small changes in the coordination environment, namely coordination number and distortion from ideal geometry, hence providing information on the local surrounding of Ti sites in TS-1, making in principle NMR a complementary technique to neutron diffraction studies.16,19 For instance, the structurally similar molecular analogues, [Ti(OTBOS)4] and [Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr)], show quite different calculated CQ values of 2.3 and 6.3 MHz, respectively, in line with the experimental values, thus demonstrating the sensitivity of CQ to small differences in coordination environment, where a simple substitution of OTBOS by OiPr induces a change in charge distribution, associated with the asymmetry in Ti-O bond lengths.",
        "Expanding on the aforementioned information on the molecular analogues, we further evaluate the sensitivity of chemical shift and the quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) for Ti sites constrained within the zeolite framework. Toward this end, we used periodic models where one silicon atom of theMFI structure is substituted by a Ti atom at various T positions and for which the local geometry around the Ti atom was either fixed or allowed to relax. We also investigated models with monomeric and dimeric Ti sites in view of our recent findings (see the Supporting Information for details).12 The NMR parameters of all these Ti sites were then calculated by cutting cluster models terminated by fluorine atoms in order to evaluate the effect of T positions, monomeric and dimeric sites, with and without relaxed structures. Overall, the calculated NMR parameters�chemical shifts and CQ� depend notably on the T site positions and only marginally on having monomeric vs dimeric sites (see Figure S11 in the Supporting Information for further details). Most notable, however, is that the calculated NMR parameters are highly dependent on the underlying periodic model used for the cluster models. While uncertainty of the calculated chemical shift values, obtained from our benchmark calculations, prohibits direct comparison with absolute values observed in experiment, the obtained CQ values span more than 30 MHz as a function of T site and model. Notably, the values dramatically increase for each T site upon geometry optimization due to increased local distortion. At this stage, 47/49Ti NMR is in principle sensitive enough to distinguish between specific T sites due to the sensitivity of the NMR parameters, but would require developing more robust NMR calculation methodologies on realistic periodic models, that include effects related to local vs periodic structural parameters, e.g. unit cell expansion upon Ti substitution, dynamics, and defect sites in zeolite structure as well as extraframework Ti sites to name but a few.",
        "In conclusion, we obtained the 47/49Ti ssNMR signatures of TS-1, despite the low Ti loading (<2 wt %). A comparison to molecular model complexes reveals that dehydrated TS-1 shows a distribution of larger quadrupolar coupling constants, which points toward more distorted Ti sites in the TS-1 structure, despite similar XAS signatures between molecular systems and TS-1. Furthermore, the absence of a 47/49Ti NMR signal for the hydrated TS-1 shows that Ti sites in the zeolite framework can adapt even more asymmetric local geometries upon adsorption of molecules (e.g., upon exposure to the atmosphere or under reaction conditions). Overall, this study highlights the feasibility of direct characterization of metal sites without a probe molecule and opens the possibility to investigate other industrially relevant titanosilicate catalysts to address the coordination environment and electronic structure of the respective Ti sites. We are currently working on exploring and developing more advanced computational models and protocols to ascribe observed NMR signatures to Ti sites in different T positions of the MFI framework.",

(28) For example, the spectroscopic signatures of CpTiCl3 and Cp*TiCl3 showed an increased chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) by >500 ppm upon replacing the protons of the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand by methyl groups (Cp*). However, measurement of these molecular complexes was only possible because of their pseudote-trahedral geometry, yielding relatively small quadrupolar coupling constants (CQ < 6 MHz).

(40) Because of their very small CQ values CPMG acquisition could not be applied without signal truncation and due to the low Ti wt % contents as the result of using the large siloxide ligands (Ti(OTBOS)4 4.4 wt % Ti and Ti(OTBOS)3(OiPr) 5.3 wt % Ti) only MAS spectra were recorded.
