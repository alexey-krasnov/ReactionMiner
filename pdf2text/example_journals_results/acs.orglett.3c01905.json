The enantioselective hetero-annulation reaction of 2-alkynylbenzimidazoles with ortho-amino-phenylketones proceeded smoothly in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid to provide axially chiral heterobiaryls with good yields and enantioselectivities. This is the first example of the combination of benzimidazole and quinoline rings at the 2-and 3-positions, respectively, into axially chiral heterobiaryls by this new strategy. Axially chiral biaryl frameworks are frequently found notonly in natural products1 and pharmaceuticals2 but also in privileged chiral ligands3 and catalysts.4 Therefore, the development of convenient and efficient methods for the construction of diverse axially chiral biaryls has attracted considerable attention over the past decades.5 In comparison with typical aromatic axially chiral compounds, such as biphenyls and binaphthyls,6 examples of heteroaromatic axially chiral compounds, particularly benzimidazole and quinoline ring-containing axially chiral compounds, have rarely been reported.5d,7 The synthesis of 2-, 4-, 5-, and 8-aryl axially chiral quinolines has been accomplished through the kinetic resolution of axially chiral 5-or 8-aryl quinolines via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation,8 the enantioselective modification of 8-aryl quinolines by aromatic electrophilic halogenation9 or aromatic C-H olefination,10 the enantiose-lective Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of aryl boronic acids with 5-or 8-bromoquinolines,11 and the organocatalytic atroposelective heterocycloaddition of 2-aminoaryl ketones/ aldehydes with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds12 or alkynes (Scheme 1a).13 To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies on the synthesis of 1-aryl axially chiral benzimidazoles, which involved organocatalytic atroposelective heterocycload-dition14 or enantioselective intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction, have been reported (Scheme 1b).15 In the above examples, the N-C chiral axis was constructed, while the benzimidazole rings were formed. However, as far as we know, the synthesis of 3-aryl axially chiral quinolines and 2-aryl axially chiral benzimidazoles is unprecedented (Scheme 1a and 1b). Quinoline and benzimidazole moieties are present in a wide range of bioactive molecules that display broad-spectrum pharmacological activities,16 and they also constitute the central core of various ligands.17 Therefore, the development of a convenient and efficient method for the construction of axially chiral compounds containing benzimidazole and quinoline rings is highly desirable. Received: June 10, 2023 In the current work, we designed and synthesized 2-alkynyl benzimidazole substrates 1 bearing an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) at the N1-position for heteroannulation with 2-aminoaryl ketones 2 to obtain a new type of axially chiral heterobiaryl compound 3 (Scheme 1c). The C-C triple bond introduced at the 2-position of the benzimidazole unit functions as an efficient Michael acceptor because of the introduction of EWG into the N1-position, thereby facilitating the intended enantioselective heteroannulation reaction under the influence of a chiral catalyst. The proposed reaction design is outlined in Scheme 1c. Aza-Michael type addition of amine 2 to 2-alkynyl benzimidazole 1 affords an axially chiral allenyl intermediate in an enantioenriched form using chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) 4 as a chiral Brønsted acid catalyst.4a,c,18 The subsequent intramolecular enamine-aldol reaction in an enantio-specific manner followed by aromatiza-tion completes the proposed heteroannulation reaction. Here we report the catalytic enantioselective heteroannulation reaction of 1 with 2 using CPA 4 as a chiral catalyst, giving rise to a new type of axially chiral heterobiaryl compound 3 in an enantioenriched form. In our initial studies, the reaction of 1-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-2-phenylethynylbenzimidazole (1a) with 2-benzoylphenyl-amine (2a) was selected as a model to optimize the reaction conditions. The results are shown in Table 1 (for details, see the Supporting Information). The organocatalyst, CPA 4, was screened in toluene at 50 °C for 24 h (entries 1-7). The intended heteroannulation reaction gave the desired product 3aa in 65% yield with 40% ee when BINOL-derived CPA (R)-4a bearing two electron-withdrawing substituents (C6F5) at the 3-and 3′-positions was examined (entry 1). The BINOL-derived CPAs (R)-4b, (R)-4c, and (R)-4d bearing sterically bulky substituents (2,4,6-(iPr)3C6H2, 9-anthryl, and SiPh3), respectively, were subsequently investigated, and no satisfac-tory results were obtained (entries 2-4, 10%-21% yields, 27%-59% ee). These results indicated that increasing the steric hindrance effect of the CPA catalysts was not conducive to catalyzing the intended reaction. To our delight, the yield and ee of product 3aa were eventually dramatically increased to 77% and 91%, respectively, by utilizing BINOL-derived CPA (R)-4e bearing stronger electron-withdrawing substituents (4-CF3C6F4) as the catalyst (entry 5). No reaction was observed when SPINOL-derived CPA (R)-4f was tested (entry 6). In comparison with the results in entry 1, almost the same yield was observed when H8-BINOL-derived CPA (R)-4g was examined as the catalyst, but the ee decreased to 28% (entry 7). The solvents were then screened using (R)-4e as the catalyst. Among the solvents (toluene, dichloromethane [DCM], Et2O, tetrahydrofuran [THF], CHCl3, MeCN, p-xylene, and C6H5Cl) examined, toluene proved to be the best solvent for obtaining an excellent ee value (entries 8-14 vs entry 5). The effect of the ratio of 1a to 2a on the reaction yield was finally investigated. The yield of product 3aa was not considerably increased, although 2.0 equiv of 2a were used (entry 15 vs entry 5). Under optimal conditions, the scope and generality of 2-arylethynylbenzimidazole derivative 1 were investigated. The results are listed in Scheme 2. The reactions of 1b-1e bearing an electron-donating group (Me and OMe) or a relatively weak EWG (F and Br) at the para-position of the benzene ring proceeded smoothly, similar to the reaction of 1a. The desired axially chiral biaryl compounds 3ba-3ea were obtained in a range of 70%-92% yields with 70%-88% ee. However, a dramatically decreased ee was observed when a strong EWG (CF3) was introduced at the para-position of the benzene ring in the 2-arylethynylbenzimidazole substrate (3fa: 71% yield, 37% ee), presumably because of the high reactivity of substrate 1f in the nucleophilic addition step with 2a (Scheme 5). A sharply decreased ee was subsequently found when para-phenyl-substituted substrate 1g was utilized (3ga: 64% yield, 13% ee). This low ee value may be caused by a relatively strong steric hindrance effect. Neither an electron-donating group (Me and OMe) nor a weak EWG (F and Cl) introduced at the meta-position of the benzene ring influenced the reaction yields and ee. The desired products 3ha-3ka were isolated in 74%-97% yields with 78%-90% ee. With the exception of MeO, the substituents Me, F, and Cl introduced at the ortho-positions of benzene rings led to the formation of desired products with relatively low ee values owing to the steric hindrance effect. Surprisingly, 91% ee was observed for the reaction of ortho-MeO-substituted substrate 1m (3ma: 44% yield, 91% ee). The free rotation of the O-C(Ar) bond might reduce the steric hindrance effect of MeO. The 2-naphthylethynylbenzimidazole substrates, 1p and 1q, were then examined under the standard conditions, and moderate enantioselectivities were observed (3pa, 63% ee; 3qa, 50% ee). The low yields of 3la and 3pa may be attributed to the steric hindrance effect of the ortho-positions. The results finally obtained demonstrated that heteroaryl ethynyl-containing substrates 1r and 1s were suitable for the intended reaction (3ra: 92% yield, 83% ee; 3sa: 70% yield, 76% ee). The scope of the ortho-aminophenylketone substrate 2 was then investigated using 1a as the reaction partner. The results are listed in Scheme 3. Reactions of (2-aminophenyl)(p-to l y l )methanone (2b) and (2 -aminopheny l )(4 -methoxyphenyl)methanone (2c) proceeded smoothly to give axially chiral biaryl compounds 3ab and 3ac in 70% and 88% yields with 86% ee and 80% ee, respectively. The reaction of substrate 2d bearing a sterically bulky substituent tert-butyl also proceeded smoothly to provide the desired product 3ad in good yield (86%) with moderate ee (56%). High yields and excellent enantioselectivities were observed when halogen atom (F, Cl, and Br)-containing substrates 2e-2g were investigated (3ae-3ag: 70%-76% yields, 87%-90% ee). The structure of 3ag was confirmed through X-ray crystallographic analysis (for details, see the Supporting Information). Finally, substrates 2h-2j bearing a substituent (Me or Cl) on the benzene ring of 2-aminophenyl were examined. Almost the same good enantioselectivities were observed (3ah: 88% ee; 3ai: 88% ee; 3aj, 81% ee), but a relatively high yield was found for product 3ah. Continued substrate extension studies showed that the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group could be used as an EWG instead of Boc. The reaction of substrate 1t with 2a proceeded smoothly under the standard conditions to furnish product 3ta in 92% yield with 69% ee (Scheme 4, eq 1). Large-scale synthesis of 3ag was performed under standard reaction conditions to demonstrate the synthetic practicality and utilization of the new methodology further (Scheme 4, eq 2). To our delight, the desired product 3ag was obtained in 63% yield with 88% ee when the reaction was conducted on a 1.0 mmol scale. The yield and ee are comparable to those obtained in the small-scale experiment. On the basis of our experimental outcomes and previous reports,19 a catalytic cycle is proposed to account for the present organocatalytic atroposelective annulation reaction (Scheme 5). Initially, catalyst (R)-4e, 1a, and 2a form assembled adduct A through a hydrogen bonding interaction. The nucleophilic attack of the amino group in 2a on an alkyne moiety in 1a results in the formation of enantioenriched allene derivative B. Subsequently, intermediate B undergoes an intramolecular enamine-aldol reaction in an enantio-specific manner, affording axially chiral intermediate C. The proposed heteroannulation reaction is complete through further dehydration of D generated from protonation of the hydroxyl group in C by (R)-4e, resulting in an aromatization to produce enantioenriched heterobiaryl product 3aa and regenerate (R)-4e. In summary, we have successfully developed the first organocatalytic atroposelective construction of axially chiral compounds containing benzimidazole and quinoline rings. The enantioselective heteroannulation reaction of 2-alkynyl benzi-midazoles with ortho-aminophenylketones proceeded smoothly in the presence of organocatalyst CPA to provide axially chiral heterobiaryls with good yields and enantioselectivities in most cases (up to 97% yield, 91% ee). This is the first example of the combination of benzimidazole and quinoline rings at the 2-and 3-positions, respectively, into axially chiral heterobiaryls using the new strategy. Studies on the practicalities of product 3 and the synthesis of other heterocycle-containing axially chiral heterobiaryls utilizing the new strategy are currently underway in our laboratory.

        "Organocatalytic Atroposelective Construction of Axially Chiral Compounds Containing Benzimidazole and Quinoline Rings",
        "ABSTRACT: An organocatalytic atroposelective strategy for the construction of axially chiral compounds containing benzimidazole and quinoline rings is described. The enantioselective hetero-annulation reaction of 2-alkynylbenzimidazoles with ortho-amino-phenylketones proceeded smoothly in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid to provide axially chiral heterobiaryls with good yields and enantioselectivities. This is the first example of the combination of benzimidazole and quinoline rings at the 2-and 3-positions, respectively, into axially chiral heterobiaryls by this new strategy.",
        "chiral biaryl frameworks are frequently found notonly in natural products1 and pharmaceuticals2 but also inprivileged chiral ligands3 and catalysts.4 Therefore, the development of convenient and efficient methods for the construction of diverse axially chiral biaryls has attracted considerable attention over the past decades.5 In comparison with typical aromatic axially chiral compounds, such as biphenyls and binaphthyls,6 examples of heteroaromatic axially chiral compounds, particularly benzimidazole and quinoline ring-containing axially chiral compounds, have rarely been reported.5d,7 The synthesis of 2-, 4-, 5-, and 8-aryl axially chiral quinolines has been accomplished through the kinetic resolution of axially chiral 5-or 8-aryl quinolines via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation,8 the enantioselective modification of 8-aryl quinolines by aromatic electrophilic halogenation9 or aromatic C-H olefination,10 the enantiose-lective Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of aryl boronic acids with 5-or 8-bromoquinolines,11 and the organocatalytic atroposelective heterocycloaddition of 2-aminoaryl ketones/ aldehydes with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds12 or alkynes (Scheme 1a).13 To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies on the synthesis of 1-aryl axially chiral benzimidazoles, which involved organocatalytic atroposelective heterocycload-dition14 or enantioselective intramolecular Buchwald-Hartwig reaction, have been reported (Scheme 1b).15 In the above examples, the N-C chiral axis was constructed, while the benzimidazole rings were formed. However, as far as we know, the synthesis of 3-aryl axially chiral quinolines and 2-aryl axially chiral benzimidazoles is unprecedented (Scheme 1a and 1b).",
        "Quinoline and benzimidazole moieties are present in a wide range of bioactive molecules that display broad-spectrum pharmacological activities,16 and they also constitute the central core of various ligands.17 Therefore, the development of a convenient and efficient method for the construction of axially chiral compounds containing benzimidazole and quinoline rings is highly desirable. Received: June 10, 2023In the current work, we designed and synthesized 2-alkynyl benzimidazole substrates 1 bearing an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) at the N1-position for heteroannulation with 2-aminoaryl ketones 2 to obtain a new type of axially chiral heterobiaryl compound 3 (Scheme 1c). The C-C triple bond introduced at the 2-position of the benzimidazole unit functions as an efficient Michael acceptor because of the introduction of EWG into the N1-position, thereby facilitating the intended enantioselective heteroannulation reaction under the influence of a chiral catalyst. The proposed reaction design is outlined in Scheme 1c. Aza-Michael type addition of amine 2 to 2-alkynyl benzimidazole 1 affords an axially chiral allenyl intermediate in an enantioenriched form using chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) 4 as a chiral Brønsted acid catalyst.4a,c,18 The subsequent intramolecular enamine-aldol reaction in an enantio-specific manner followed by aromatiza-tion completes the proposed heteroannulation reaction. Here we report the catalytic enantioselective heteroannulation reaction of 1 with 2 using CPA 4 as a chiral catalyst, giving rise to a new type of axially chiral heterobiaryl compound 3 in an enantioenriched form.",
        "In our initial studies, the reaction of 1-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-2-phenylethynylbenzimidazole (1a) with 2-benzoylphenyl-amine (2a) was selected as a model to optimize the reaction conditions. The results are shown in Table 1 (for details, see the Supporting Information). The organocatalyst, CPA 4, was screened in toluene at 50 °C for 24 h (entries 1-7). The intended heteroannulation reaction gave the desired product 3aa in 65% yield with 40% ee when BINOL-derived CPA (R)-4a bearing two electron-withdrawing substituents (C6F5) at the 3-and 3′-positions was examined (entry 1). The BINOL-derived CPAs (R)-4b, (R)-4c, and (R)-4d bearing sterically bulky substituents (2,4,6-(iPr)3C6H2, 9-anthryl, and SiPh3), respectively, were subsequently investigated, and no satisfac-tory results were obtained (entries 2-4, 10%-21% yields, 27%-59% ee). These results indicated that increasing the steric hindrance effect of the CPA catalysts was not conducive to catalyzing the intended reaction. To our delight, the yield and ee of product 3aa were eventually dramatically increased to 77% and 91%, respectively, by utilizing BINOL-derived CPA (R)-4e bearing stronger electron-withdrawing substituents (4-CF3C6F4) as the catalyst (entry 5). No reaction was observed when SPINOL-derived CPA (R)-4f was tested (entry 6). In comparison with the results in entry 1, almost the same yield was observed when H8-BINOL-derived CPA (R)-4g was examined as the catalyst, but the ee decreased to 28% (entry 7). The solvents were then screened using (R)-4e as the catalyst. Among the solvents (toluene, dichloromethane [DCM], Et2O, tetrahydrofuran [THF], CHCl3, MeCN, p-xylene, and C6H5Cl) examined, toluene proved to be the best solvent for obtaining an excellent ee value (entries 8-14 vs entry 5). The effect of the ratio of 1a to 2a on the reaction yield was finally investigated. The yield of product 3aa was not considerably increased, although 2.0 equiv of 2a were used (entry 15 vs entry 5).",
        "Under optimal conditions, the scope and generality of 2-arylethynylbenzimidazole derivative 1 were investigated. The results are listed in Scheme 2. The reactions of 1b-1e bearing an electron-donating group (Me and OMe) or a relatively weak EWG (F and Br) at the para-position of the benzene ring proceeded smoothly, similar to the reaction of 1a. The desired axially chiral biaryl compounds 3ba-3ea were obtained in a range of 70%-92% yields with 70%-88% ee. However, a dramatically decreased ee was observed when a strong EWG (CF3) was introduced at the para-position of the benzene ring in the 2-arylethynylbenzimidazole substrate (3fa: 71% yield, 37% ee), presumably because of the high reactivity of substrate 1f in the nucleophilic addition step with 2a (Scheme 5). A sharply decreased ee was subsequently found when para-phenyl-substituted substrate 1g was utilized (3ga: 64% yield, 13% ee). This low ee value may be caused by a relatively strong steric hindrance effect. Neither an electron-donating group (Me and OMe) nor a weak EWG (F and Cl) introduced at the meta-position of the benzene ring influenced the reaction yields and ee. The desired products 3ha-3ka were isolated in 74%-97% yields with 78%-90% ee. With the exception of MeO, the substituents Me, F, and Cl introduced at the ortho-positions of benzene rings led to the formation of desired products with relatively low ee values owing to the steric hindrance effect. Surprisingly, 91% ee was observed for the reaction of ortho-MeO-substituted substrate 1m (3ma: 44% yield, 91% ee). The free rotation of the O-C(Ar) bond might reduce the steric hindrance effect of MeO. The 2-naphthylethynylbenzimidazole substrates, 1p and 1q, were then examined under the standard conditions, and moderate enantioselectivities were observed (3pa, 63% ee; 3qa, 50% ee). The low yields of 3la and 3pa may be attributed to the steric hindrance effect of the ortho-positions. The results finally obtained demonstrated that heteroaryl ethynyl-containing substrates 1r and 1s were suitable for the intended reaction (3ra: 92% yield, 83% ee; 3sa: 70% yield, 76% ee).",
        "The scope of the ortho-aminophenylketone substrate 2 was then investigated using 1a as the reaction partner. The results are listed in Scheme 3. Reactions of (2-aminophenyl)(p-to l y l )methanone (2b) and (2 -aminopheny l )(4 -methoxyphenyl)methanone (2c) proceeded smoothly to give axially chiral biaryl compounds 3ab and 3ac in 70% and 88% yields with 86% ee and 80% ee, respectively. The reaction of substrate 2d bearing a sterically bulky substituent tert-butyl also proceeded smoothly to provide the desired product 3ad in good yield (86%) with moderate ee (56%). High yields and excellent enantioselectivities were observed when halogen atom (F, Cl, and Br)-containing substrates 2e-2g were investigated (3ae-3ag: 70%-76% yields, 87%-90% ee). The structure of 3ag was confirmed through X-ray crystallographic analysis (for details, see the Supporting Information). Finally, substrates 2h-2j bearing a substituent (Me or Cl) on the benzene ring of 2-aminophenyl were examined. Almost the same good enantioselectivities were observed (3ah: 88% ee; 3ai: 88% ee; 3aj, 81% ee), but a relatively high yield was found for product 3ah.",
        "Continued substrate extension studies showed that the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group could be used as an EWG instead of Boc. The reaction of substrate 1t with 2a proceeded smoothly under the standard conditions to furnish product 3ta in 92% yield with 69% ee (Scheme 4, eq 1). Large-scalesynthesis of 3ag was performed under standard reaction conditions to demonstrate the synthetic practicality and utilization of the new methodology further (Scheme 4, eq 2). To our delight, the desired product 3ag was obtained in 63% yield with 88% ee when the reaction was conducted on a 1.0 mmol scale. The yield and ee are comparable to those obtained in the small-scale experiment.",
        "On the basis of our experimental outcomes and previous reports,19 a catalytic cycle is proposed to account for the present organocatalytic atroposelective annulation reaction (Scheme 5). Initially, catalyst (R)-4e, 1a, and 2a form assembled adduct A through a hydrogen bonding interaction. The nucleophilic attack of the amino group in 2a on an alkyne moiety in 1a results in the formation of enantioenriched allene derivative B. Subsequently, intermediate B undergoes an intramolecular enamine-aldol reaction in an enantio-specific manner, affording axially chiral intermediate C. The proposed heteroannulation reaction is complete through further dehydration of D generated from protonation of the hydroxyl group in C by (R)-4e, resulting in an aromatization to produce enantioenriched heterobiaryl product 3aa and regenerate (R)-4e.",
        "In summary, we have successfully developed the first organocatalytic atroposelective construction of axially chiralcompounds containing benzimidazole and quinoline rings. The enantioselective heteroannulation reaction of 2-alkynyl benzi-midazoles with ortho-aminophenylketones proceeded smoothly in the presence of organocatalyst CPA to provide axially chiral heterobiaryls with good yields and enantioselectivities in most cases (up to 97% yield, 91% ee). This is the first example of the combination of benzimidazole and quinoline rings at the 2-and 3-positions, respectively, into axially chiral heterobiaryls using the new strategy. Studies on the practicalities of product 3 and the synthesis of other heterocycle-containing axially chiral heterobiaryls utilizing the new strategy are currently underway in our laboratory.",
