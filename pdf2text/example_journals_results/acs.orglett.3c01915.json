By using the 3,5-dimethylphenyl-derived ArPNO catalyst, the phthalidyl esters were obtained in up to 97% yield with 97% ee at room temperature. Two phthalidyl esters of prodrugs, talosalate and talmetacin, were generated. By control experiments and density functional theory calculations, an acyl transfer mechanism was proposed. Phthalides are the major structures present in biologicallyactive molecules and various natural products.1 Phthalidyl ester drugs are widely used in clinical applications, which play specific roles in pain, anti-inflammatory, and other aspects.2 Among these drugs, talosalate is a new phthalidyl ester with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.3 All of the above phthalates contain unstable acetal structures with a chiral center, and formation of the corresponding enantiomeric structures is difficult. Therefore, constructing an enantioen-riched phthalidyl ester is challenging.4 The synthesis of chiral phenol ester prodrugs has significant implications for the future biomedical field and methodology. Acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR)5 is an effective method for constructing chiral phthalidyl ester derivatives.6-10 In 2008, Yamada and co-workers pioneered the synthesis of optical phthalidyl esters by an acylative DKR reaction with chiral DMAP catalysts using hemiaminal and acid anhydrides, albeit with moderate enantioselectivities.6 In 2019, Chi and co-workers developed a carbene-catalyzed acylative DKR reaction for rapid access to optically enriched phthalidyl esters.7 The stereoselective control of the conversion of carboxylic acid into phthalidyl ester via hemiacetal was successfully achieved (Scheme 1a). Then, Chi’s group successfully conducted the asymmetric acylation of hydroxyphthalide to afford enantioen-riched phthalidyl esters using carbene as the catalyst and quinone as the oxidant (Scheme 1b).8 In 2021, Zhang and co-workers synthesized phthalidyl esters in up to 97% yield with 99% ee using a chiral bicyclic imidazole organocatalyst at -80 °C by the acylative DKR process. Significantly, this reaction follows a type of a base-catalyzed mechanism (Scheme 1c).9 The DKR studies of phthalidyl esters were realized by the groups of Chi and Zhang using carbene and bicyclic imidazole catalysts, respectively. Although these methods exhibited excellent enantioselectivities, developing mild and effective methods to synthesize chiral phthalidyl ester drugs is imperative. The acylative DKR reaction is widely used to synthesize chiral secondary alcohols.11 In 2012, Fu and co-workers first reported the DMAP-catalyzed enantioselective acylative DKR of secondary alcohols.12 Later, the Piotrowski and Kamlet group synthesized azole hemiaminal esters by the DKR reaction using chiral DMAP as the catalyst.13 Zhang’s group developed a chiral bicyclic imidazole catalyst, which was used for the acyl transfer reaction to synthesize some chiral prodrugs.14 Recently, chiral DMAP-N-oxides15,16 and 4-aryl-pyridine-N-oxides (ArPNO) were developed as acyl transfer Received: June 11, 2023 Letterpubs.acs.org/OrgLett © XXXX American Chemical Society A https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.3c01915 Org.

Compared with Zhang’s work9 using acyl chlorides as electrophiles at -80 °C through a base-catalyzed mechanism, our work could use anhydrides or acyl chlorides as electrophiles at room temperature through an acyl transfer mechanism, which was a good complement to Zhang’s work. Initially, the DKR reaction of 3-hydroxyphthalide 1a with acid anhydride 2a was selected as the model reaction (Table 1). By using chiral DMAP-N-oxides C1a and C1b as the catalysts, product 3aa was obtained in 22% and 14% ee, respectively (entries 1 and 2). Comparatively, in the presence of chiral ArPNO C2a, adduct 3aa was obtained in 94% yield with 83% ee (entry 3). Subsequently, several chiral ArPNO compounds C2b-h were evaluated. In the case of chiral ArPNO C2a, containing two bulky isopropyl groups at the ortho positions of the aniline moiety, better results were obtained (entry 3 vs entries 4 and 5). Then, ArPNO derivatives C2d-h with different aryl groups at the C4 position of pyridine were investigated (entries 6-10). When 3,5-dimethyl-substituted catalyst C2d was used, product 3aa was obtained with better enantioselectivity with 85% (entry 6). Next, different bases and solvents were screened. Varying the bases did not lead to improved results (entries 11-15). In the absence of a base, when mesitylene was used as the solvent, adduct 3aa was obtained in 95% yield with 89% ee (entry 16). Furthermore, several acid anhydrides were screened, and pivalic anhydride was found to be the best one, affording 3ac in 95% yield with 94% ee (entry 18). By increasing the amount of substrate 2c to 4.0 equiv, the enantioselectivity was improved to 97% ee (entry 20). It is worth noting that the enantioselectivity of the product 3ac was decreased to 95% when the amount of catalyst reduced to 5 mol % (entry 21). With the optimal reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 20), the scope of phthalide derivatives was explored (Scheme 2). When pivaloyl chloride was used as the substrate, product 3ac was obtained in 91% yield with 95% ee. Substrates bearing fluoro and chloro groups at the 5-or 6-position of the phenyl ring were acylated, affording corresponding products 3bc-3ec with 92-94% ee. Additionally, the desired products 3fc-3hc with the bromide group at different positions were obtained in high yields and enantioselectivies. 5-Iodide-substituted reactant 1i also was used as a suitable reactant to afford product 3ic. When a substrate bearing a methoxy group at the 6-or 4-position of the phenyl ring was employed, desired products 3jc and 3kc were obtained in 84% and 90% yields with 88% and 95% ee, respectively. The substrate with an ester group at position 6 of the phenyl ring was acylated to obtain product 3lc in 93% yield with 94% ee. Furthermore, when two strong electron-withdrawing-group-substituted reactants 1m and 1n were used, 3mc and 3nc were obtained in 97% and 89% yields, respectively, with corresponding ee values of 93% and 95%. Notably, the ee of product 3oc containing an alkenyl framework instead of an aryl group was maintained at 97%. When diphenyl acetyl chloride (DPACl) was used to replace pivalic anhydride for the reaction, the corresponding adduct 3af was obtained in 91% yield and 92% ee. Under the optimized conditions, the gram scale of product 3ac was conducted with 88% yield (1.02 g) and 91% ee. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the absolute config-uration of the desired product 3ac was the S-configuration. Due to the easier availability of acyl chloride compared to anhydride, we attempted to use acyl chloride for the synthesis of prodrugs. The prodrug molecules talosalate and talmetacin were obtained in 85% and 92% ee, respectively (Scheme 3). Although an excellent enantioselectivity (88% ee) for talmetacin was obtained in Zhang’s work,9 our method has higher enantioselectivity (92% ee) under mild conditions. Several control experiments were performed (Scheme 4). When 4-aryl-pyridine C3d, a reduced product of ArPNO C2d, was used, the reaction did not occur, indicating that the N-oxide group was essential for the reaction. The importance of the N-H proton of the amide was investigated using chiral ArPNO C2i and its N-Me derivative C2j. When C2j was used, product 3ac was obtained in 0% ee, suggesting that the N-H proton of the amide framework was critical for the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The target product was not obtained by using the 4-H-pyridine-N-oxide C2k catalyst, indicating that the aryl group at the C-4 position was necessary. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate our proposed reaction mechanism and obtain a theoretical explanation for the observed high stereoselectivity. As shown in Figure 1, a quadrant model was used to explore the active center of catalyst C2d, where the oxygen atom was used as the coordinate origin. As the activity and stereoselectivity of the N-H proton on the amide play key roles in the reaction, the substrates were placed in the second and third quadrants. Moreover, as the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group was present in the third quadrant, the reactant was permitted to approach only the second quadrant. The DKR reaction mechanism was divided into two steps: Nucleophilic attack of catalyst C2d with pivalic anhydride 2c generated the acyloxypridinium cation (step 1), followed by nucleophilic substitution of (S)-1a with the acyloxypridinium cation (step 2). Step 1 commences via hydrogen bonding (H-bond) between (S)-1a, catalyst C2d, and pivalic anhydride 2c, and the π-π interaction between the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group on catalyst C2d and the phenyl ring on substrate (S)-1a afforded complex RC. Then, with the oxygen atom of the N-oxide acting as the nucleophilic center, the nucleophilic addition of catalyst C2d occurred along the Re face of pivalic anhydride 2c. The activation free energy was calculated to be 15.3 kcal/mol via transition state TS1. At the same time, the C-O single bond of pivalic anhydride 2c was cleaved to generate the pivalate anion, which was captured by the H-bond from (S)-1a. In intermediate IM1, the o-acylated pyridinium cation was formed and (S)-1a was linked together with the amide N-H bond and the pivalate anion via H-bonds. In step 2, the less hindered intermediate IM2 was formed with the concomitant destruction of the H-bond between the amide N-H on C2d and (S)-1a, as well as the creation of an H-bond between the amide N-H on C2d and the pivalate anion. Subsequently, intermediate IM2 could undergo acyl transfer via TS2 with an energy barrier of 14.0 kcal/mol, generating pivalic acid (PA) as the product and eventually product (S)-3ac. To further analyze the stereoselectivity of the reaction, the stereoselectivity of enantio-determining transition states TS2 was further investigated. As shown in Figure 2a,b, the relative free energy of (Re,S,f1)-TS2 was 6.0 kcal/mol (ΔΔG⧧) less than that of (Re,R,f1)-TS2. The conformers with (S)-3ac are more stable than the conformers with (R)-3ac. The experimental results also confirmed that (S)-3ac was a major product. Other conformers of TS2 were also determined by theoretical calculations, as shown in Figure 2c,d. (Re,S,f1)-TS2 was 6.0 kcal/mol less favorable than (Re,S,f 2)-TS2, and similarly, (Re,R,f1)-TS2 was 1.3 kcal/mol less favorable than (Re,R,f 2)-TS2. When catalyst C2d attacked pivalic anhydride 2c from the Si face (Figure 2e,f), the relative free energy value of (Si,S,f1)-TS2 was 2.7 kcal/mol less than that of (Si,R,f1)-TS2, indicating that (S)-3ac was the main compound. Also, the relative free energy values of (Si,R,f 2)-TS2 and (Si,S,f 2)-TS2 were higher than those of (Si,R,f1)-TS2 and (Si,S,f1)-TS2, respectively (Figure 2g,h). Moreover, the relative free energy values of (Si,R,f1)-TS2 and (Si,S,f1)-TS2 were significantly higher than those of (Re,R,f1)-TS2 and (Re,S,f1)-TS2, respectively. The above theoretical chemical study showed that comparing the attack of the Re and Si faces was crucial for understanding the accurate reaction pathway. The results showed that (Re,S,f1)-TS2 exhibited the lowest relative free energy, which was consistent with the experimental results, in that (S)-3ac was the dominant enantiomer. Based on previous studies,6-10 a possible mechanism of acylated DKR was proposed in Figure 3. First, the ring opening of phthalide occurred, affording o-carboxybenzaldehyde. Second, o-carboxybenzaldehyde underwent intramolecular acylation to obtain two substrates with different configurations. At the same time, ArPNO C2d and pivalic anhydride 2c underwent nucleophilic attack to form an acyloxypyridinium cation. (S)-1a underwent a nucleophilic substitution reaction via a lower relative free-energy transition state, generating the main product (S)-3ac while simultaneously releasing catalyst C2d. For (R)-1a, owing to the inability to effectively generate van der Waals forces with the pivalic acid anion, the corresponding transition state exhibited a higher relative free energy, thereby slowly producing (R)-3ac. Therefore, un-reacted (R)-3ac in turn was converted to o-carboxybenzalde-hyde, leading to in situ racemization. In conclusion, an acylative DKR for racemic 3-hydroxyph-thalates using a chiral ArPNO nucleophilic organocatalyst was reported for the synthesis of chiral phthalates under mild conditions without additives. By using ArPNO C2d as the catalyst, various chiral phthalates were synthesized in 84-97% yields and 85-97% ee. The developed method was used to prepare the phthalate prodrugs talosalate and talmetacin. Our developed reaction applied anhydrides or acyl chlorides at room temperature through an acyl transfer mechanism. This was a good complement to Zhang’s work,9 which utilized acyl chlorides as electrophiles at -80 °C through a base-catalyzed mechanism.

        "ArPNO-Catalyzed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of 3‑Hydroxyphthalides: Access to Enantioenriched Phthalidyl Esters",
        "ABSTRACT: A chiral 4-aryl-pyridine-N-oxide nucleophilic organocatalyst was used to synthesize chiral phthalidyl ester prodrugs by the acylative dynamic kinetic resolution process. By using the 3,5-dimethylphenyl-derived ArPNO catalyst, the phthalidyl esters were obtained in up to 97% yield with 97% ee at room temperature. Two phthalidyl esters of prodrugs, talosalate and talmetacin, were generated. By control experiments and density functional theory calculations, an acyl transfer mechanism was proposed.",
        "Phthalidesare the major structures present in biologicallyactive molecules and various natural products.1 Phthalidylester drugs are widely used in clinical applications, which play specific roles in pain, anti-inflammatory, and other aspects.2 Among these drugs, talosalate is a new phthalidyl ester with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.3 All of the above phthalates contain unstable acetal structures with a chiral center, and formation of the corresponding enantiomeric structures is difficult. Therefore, constructing an enantioen-riched phthalidyl ester is challenging.4 The synthesis of chiral phenol ester prodrugs has significant implications for the future biomedical field and methodology.",
        "Acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR)5 is an effective method for constructing chiral phthalidyl ester derivatives.6-10 In 2008, Yamada and co-workers pioneered the synthesis of optical phthalidyl esters by an acylative DKR reaction with chiral DMAP catalysts using hemiaminal and acid anhydrides, albeit with moderate enantioselectivities.6 In 2019, Chi and co-workers developed a carbene-catalyzed acylative DKR reaction for rapid access to optically enriched phthalidyl esters.7 The stereoselective control of the conversion of carboxylic acid into phthalidyl ester via hemiacetal was successfully achieved (Scheme 1a). Then, Chi’s group successfully conducted the asymmetric acylation of hydroxyphthalide to afford enantioen-riched phthalidyl esters using carbene as the catalyst and quinone as the oxidant (Scheme 1b).8 In 2021, Zhang and co-workers synthesized phthalidyl esters in up to 97% yield with 99% ee using a chiral bicyclic imidazole organocatalyst at -80 °C by the acylative DKR process. Significantly, this reaction follows a type of a base-catalyzed mechanism (Scheme 1c).9 The DKR studies of phthalidyl esters were realized by the groups of Chi and Zhang using carbene and bicyclic imidazole catalysts, respectively. Although these methods exhibited excellent enantioselectivities, developing mild and effective methods to synthesize chiral phthalidyl ester drugs is imperative.",
        "The acylative DKR reaction is widely used to synthesize chiral secondary alcohols.11 In 2012, Fu and co-workers first reported the DMAP-catalyzed enantioselective acylative DKR of secondary alcohols.12 Later, the Piotrowski and Kamlet group synthesized azole hemiaminal esters by the DKR reaction using chiral DMAP as the catalyst.13 Zhang’s group developed a chiral bicyclic imidazole catalyst, which was used for the acyl transfer reaction to synthesize some chiral prodrugs.14 Recently, chiral DMAP-N-oxides15,16 and 4-aryl-pyridine-N-oxides (ArPNO) were developed as acyl transfer© XXXX American Chemical Societycatalysts.17 Therefore, an alternative nucleophilic catalytic mechanism was discovered by an acylative DKR reaction to obtain chiral phthalidyl ester prodrugs using chiral ArPNO catalysts at room temperature (Scheme 1d). Compared with Zhang’s work9 using acyl chlorides as electrophiles at -80 °C through a base-catalyzed mechanism, our work could use anhydrides or acyl chlorides as electrophiles at room temperature through an acyl transfer mechanism, which was a good complement to Zhang’s work.",
        "Initially, the DKR reaction of 3-hydroxyphthalide 1a with acid anhydride 2a was selected as the model reaction (Table 1). By using chiral DMAP-N-oxides C1a and C1b as the catalysts, product 3aa was obtained in 22% and 14% ee, respectively (entries 1 and 2). Comparatively, in the presence of chiral ArPNO C2a, adduct 3aa was obtained in 94% yield with 83% ee (entry 3). Subsequently, several chiral ArPNO compounds C2b-h were evaluated. In the case of chiral ArPNO C2a, containing two bulky isopropyl groups at the ortho positions of the aniline moiety, better results were obtained (entry 3 vs entries 4 and 5). Then, ArPNO derivatives C2d-h with different aryl groups at the C4 position of pyridine were investigated (entries 6-10). When 3,5-dimethyl-substituted catalyst C2d was used, product 3aa was obtained with better enantioselectivity with 85% (entry 6). Next, different bases and solvents were screened. Varying the bases did not lead to improved results (entries 11-15). In the absence of a base, when mesitylene was used as the solvent, adduct 3aa was obtained in 95% yield with 89% ee (entry 16). Furthermore, several acid anhydrides were screened, and pivalic anhydride was found to be the best one, affording 3ac in 95% yield with 94% ee (entry 18). By increasing the amount of substrate 2c to 4.0 equiv, the enantioselectivity was improved to 97% ee (entry 20). It is worth noting that the enantioselectivity of the product 3ac was decreased to 95% when the amount of catalyst reduced to 5 mol % (entry 21).",
        "With the optimal reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 20), the scope of phthalide derivatives was explored (Scheme 2). When pivaloyl chloride was used as the substrate, product 3ac was obtained in 91% yield with 95% ee. Substrates bearing fluoro and chloro groups at the 5-or 6-position of the phenyl ring were acylated, affording corresponding products 3bc-3ec with 92-94% ee. Additionally, the desired products 3fc-3hc with the bromide group at different positions were obtained in high yields and enantioselectivies. 5-Iodide-substituted reactant 1i also was used as a suitable reactant to afford product 3ic. When a substrate bearing a methoxy group at the 6-or 4-position of the phenyl ring was employed, desired products 3jc and 3kc were obtained in 84% and 90% yields with 88% and 95% ee, respectively. The substrate with an ester group at position 6 of the phenyl ring was acylated to obtain product 3lc in 93% yield with 94% ee. Furthermore, when two strong electron-withdrawing-group-substituted reactants 1m and 1n were used, 3mc and 3nc were obtained in 97% and 89% yields, respectively, with corresponding ee values of 93% and 95%. Notably, the ee of product 3oc containing an alkenyl framework instead of an aryl group was maintained at 97%. When diphenyl acetyl chloride (DPACl) was used to replace pivalic anhydride for the reaction, the corresponding adduct 3af was obtained in 91% yield and 92% ee. Under the optimized conditions, the gram scale of product 3ac was conducted with 88% yield (1.02 g) and 91% ee. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the absolute config-uration of the desired product 3ac was the S-configuration.",
        "Due to the easier availability of acyl chloride compared to anhydride, we attempted to use acyl chloride for the synthesis of prodrugs. The prodrug molecules talosalate and talmetacin were obtained in 85% and 92% ee, respectively (Scheme 3). Although an excellent enantioselectivity (88% ee) for talmetacin was obtained in Zhang’s work,9 our method has higher enantioselectivity (92% ee) under mild conditions.",
        "Several control experiments were performed (Scheme 4). When 4-aryl-pyridine C3d, a reduced product of ArPNO C2d, was used, the reaction did not occur, indicating that the N-oxide group was essential for the reaction. The importance of the N-H proton of the amide was investigated using chiral ArPNO C2i and its N-Me derivative C2j. When C2j was used, product 3ac was obtained in 0% ee, suggesting that the N-H proton of the amide framework was critical for the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The target product was not obtained by using the 4-H-pyridine-N-oxide C2k catalyst, indicating that the aryl group at the C-4 position was necessary.",
        "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate our proposed reaction mechanism and obtain a theoretical explanation for the observed high stereoselectivity. As shown in Figure 1, a quadrant model wasused to explore the active center of catalyst C2d, where the oxygen atom was used as the coordinate origin. As the activity and stereoselectivity of the N-H proton on the amide play key roles in the reaction, the substrates were placed in the second and third quadrants. Moreover, as the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group was present in the third quadrant, the reactant was permitted to approach only the second quadrant.",
        "The DKR reaction mechanism was divided into two steps: Nucleophilic attack of catalyst C2d with pivalic anhydride 2c generated the acyloxypridinium cation (step 1), followed by nucleophilic substitution of (S)-1a with the acyloxypridinium cation (step 2). Step 1 commences via hydrogen bonding (H-bond) between (S)-1a, catalyst C2d, and pivalic anhydride 2c, and the π-π interaction between the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group on catalyst C2d and the phenyl ring on substrate (S)-1a afforded complex RC. Then, with the oxygen atom of the N-oxide acting as the nucleophilic center, the nucleophilic addition of catalyst C2d occurred along the Re face of pivalic anhydride 2c. The activation free energy was calculated to be 15.3 kcal/mol via transition state TS1. At the same time, the C-O single bond of pivalic anhydride 2c was cleaved to generate the pivalate anion, which was captured by the H-bond from (S)-1a. In intermediate IM1, the o-acylated pyridinium cation was formed and (S)-1a was linked together with the amide N-H bond and the pivalate anion via H-bonds. In step 2, the less hindered intermediate IM2 was formed with the concomitant destruction of the H-bond between the amideN-H on C2d and (S)-1a, as well as the creation of an H-bond between the amide N-H on C2d and the pivalate anion. Subsequently, intermediate IM2 could undergo acyl transfer via TS2 with an energy barrier of 14.0 kcal/mol, generating pivalic acid (PA) as the product and eventually product (S)-3ac.",
        "To further analyze the stereoselectivity of the reaction, the stereoselectivity of enantio-determining transition states TS2 was further investigated. As shown in Figure 2a,b, the relativefree energy of (Re,S,f1)-TS2 was 6.0 kcal/mol (ΔΔG⧧) less than that of (Re,R,f1)-TS2. The conformers with (S)-3ac are more stable than the conformers with (R)-3ac. The experimental results also confirmed that (S)-3ac was a major product. Other conformers of TS2 were also determined by theoretical calculations, as shown in Figure 2c,d. (Re,S,f1)-TS2 was 6.0 kcal/mol less favorable than (Re,S,f 2)-TS2, and similarly, (Re,R,f1)-TS2 was 1.3 kcal/mol less favorable than (Re,R,f 2)-TS2.",
        "When catalyst C2d attacked pivalic anhydride 2c from the Si face (Figure 2e,f), the relative free energy value of (Si,S,f1)-TS2 was 2.7 kcal/mol less than that of (Si,R,f1)-TS2, indicating that (S)-3ac was the main compound. Also, the relative free energy values of (Si,R,f 2)-TS2 and (Si,S,f 2)-TS2 were higher than those of (Si,R,f1)-TS2 and (Si,S,f1)-TS2, respectively (Figure 2g,h). Moreover, the relative free energy values of (Si,R,f1)-TS2 and (Si,S,f1)-TS2 were significantly higher than those of (Re,R,f1)-TS2 and (Re,S,f1)-TS2, respectively. The above theoretical chemical study showed that comparing the attack of the Re and Si faces was crucial for understanding the accurate reaction pathway. The results showed that (Re,S,f1)-TS2 exhibited the lowest relative free energy, which was consistent with the experimental results, in that (S)-3ac was the dominant enantiomer.",
        "Based on previous studies,6-10 a possible mechanism of acylated DKR was proposed in Figure 3. First, the ring opening of phthalide occurred, affording o-carboxybenzaldehyde. Second, o-carboxybenzaldehyde underwent intramolecular acylation to obtain two substrates with different configurations. At the same time, ArPNO C2d and pivalic anhydride 2c underwent nucleophilic attack to form an acyloxypyridinium cation. (S)-1a underwent a nucleophilic substitution reaction via a lower relative free-energy transition state, generating the main product (S)-3ac while simultaneously releasing catalyst C2d. For (R)-1a, owing to the inability to effectively generate van der Waals forces with the pivalic acid anion, the corresponding transition state exhibited a higher relative free energy, thereby slowly producing (R)-3ac. Therefore, un-reacted (R)-3ac in turn was converted to o-carboxybenzalde-hyde, leading to in situ racemization.",
        "In conclusion, an acylative DKR for racemic 3-hydroxyph-thalates using a chiral ArPNO nucleophilic organocatalyst was reported for the synthesis of chiral phthalates under mild conditions without additives. By using ArPNO C2d as the catalyst, various chiral phthalates were synthesized in 84-97% yields and 85-97% ee. The developed method was used to prepare the phthalate prodrugs talosalate and talmetacin. Our developed reaction applied anhydrides or acyl chlorides at room temperature through an acyl transfer mechanism. This was a good complement to Zhang’s work,9 which utilized acyl chlorides as electrophiles at -80 °C through a base-catalyzed mechanism.",
