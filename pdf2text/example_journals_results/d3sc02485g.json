Published b [3+2]-cycloaddition of 2,3-disubstituted cyclobutenones: vicinal quaternary stereocenters construction and skeletal functionalization† Licheng Lu and Ping Lu * Cycloaddition is a fundamental transformation, featuring the assembly of complex cyclic molecules with multiple stereocenters. We report here a silver-catalyzed [3+2]-cycloaddition of 2,3-disubstituted cyclobutenones with an array of azomethine ylide precursors iminoesters, furnishing azabicycles in good yields and enantioselectivities. Up to three contiguous all-carbon quaternary centers, including two angular stereocenters, could be constructed efficiently, due to high reactivity of strained cyclobutenones. Subsequent skeletal remodeling provided versatile molecules with distinct structural characters. Introduction Stereoselective organic synthesis is a continuously evolving eld in the organic community, and substantial progress has been achieved with the development of creative and elegant meth-odologies. As a fundamental organic reaction, cycloaddition features a powerful construction of complex cyclic molecules with multiple stereocenters (Scheme 1a).1,2 However, the effi-cient enantioselective construction of the all-carbon quaternary stereocenters is still synthetically challenging due to inherent steric and conformational demands encountered in the preparation.3–5 On the other hand, skeletal functionalization, especially skeletal editing has emerged as an appealing approach to accessing new chemical space.6–12 In this context, 3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane derivatives have garnered our interest. These derivatives have been used as bioisosteres of piperazine in the design of biologically active compounds (Scheme 1b).13,14 We envisioned that an enantioselective construction of such a bicyclic ring system would create vicinal stereocenters and provide a potentially valuable platform for skeletal modication. Cyclobutenones have been used as highly reactive dien-ophiles due to their inherent ring strain.15 Enantioselective functionalization of performed four-membered ring substrates has become an efficient strategy to synthesize enantioenriched cyclobutane derivatives.16–24 Cyclobutenones have been utilized and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, hai 200433, P.

F or other electronic format see DOI: y the Royal Society of Chemistry as dienophiles in the enantioselective Diels–Alder reaction and natural product synthesis (Scheme 1c).25,26 We postulated that new ring systems could be prepared with versatile cycloaddition partners and the corresponding adducts would offer a new entry for structural modications. 1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition has demonstrated its powerful utility in organic chemistry.27,28 We envisioned that a [3+2]-cycloaddition of 2,3-disubstituted cyclobutenones with azomethine ylide precursors iminoesters would afford the 3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane derivatives con-taining two angular quaternary centers in a stereocontrolled manner (Scheme 1d). The regioselective ring-opening reaction of cyclobutanones could provide densely substituted pyrroli-dines,29,30 and cyclobutanes could be subsequently obtained employing the nitrogen deletion method.31 Similarly, the ring-opening reaction of 3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes would generate acyclic dienes via simultaneous openings of both pyrrolidine and cyclobutane rings. Herein, we report our work on these speculations, beneting from the enhanced reactivity of strained cyclobutenones. Results and discussion We started our studies with the reaction of 2-methyl-3-methoxycabonylcyclobutenone 1 and methyl (E)-2-(benzylide-neamino)acetate 2a (Table 1). Inspired by the work of Carre-tero,32 the copper catalytic system was investigated. Aer an initial evaluation of chiral ligands (see Table S1† for full details), the copper-catalysed cycloaddition afforded the desired 3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane 3a in 93% yield and 56% ee using (S)-Segphos (L1) as a ligand and t-BuOK as a base. Further opti-mization of Segphos-type ligands (L2–L5) gave no improvement. The enantioselectivity was slightly enhanced using mild base Chem. Sci.
