The method relies on the cocatalytic effect of a chiral dual-hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) with hydrogen chloride. Experimental evidence is provided for a stepwise mechanism where protonation of the alkene generates a short-lived, high-energy carbocation, which is followed by C-C bond migration to deliver the enantioenriched product. This research applies strong acid/chiral HBD cocatalysis to weakly basic olefinic substrates and lays the foundation for further investigations of enantioselective reactions involving high-energy cationic intermediates. Brønsted acid catalysis holds unique importance as areactivity principle in both chemical and biological synthesis. In recent years, significant effort has been focused on controlling absolute stereochemical outcomes in acid-catalyzed reactions, with a primary approach involving the design and implementation of small-molecule chiral Brønsted acids.1,2 A broad array of highly effective chiral catalysts of varying acidity have been identified, enabling the development of numerous important organic transformations with high enantioselectivity.3 In this regard, particular success has been achieved in reactions engaging substrates bearing basic functional groups such as imines.2,4 Extension of these systems to less basic substrate classes remains challenging, though noteworthy advances have been achieved recently for enantioselective reactions involving activation of carbonyl groups5 or simple olefins.6 A complementary approach to asymmetric catalysis in reactions requiring substrate activation with strong Brønsted acids involves engaging neutral, chiral anion-binding catalysts capable of associating with the conjugate bases of achiral mineral acids. This strategy offers the potential to access chiral variants of Brønsted acids possessing an essentially unlimited range of acidities. To this end, chiral dual-hydrogen-bond donors (HBDs) have been utilized to impart enantioselectivity in transformations of imines and carbonyl compounds promoted by sulfonic acids or HCl (Figure 1A).7,8 We sought to determine whether this cocatalysis concept could be extended to reaction of olefins that upon protonation generate carbocationic intermediates lacking heteroatom stabilization, focusing on the specific case of protio-semipinacol 1,2-ring-expansion processes (Figure 1B). Traditionally, enantioselective semipinacol rearrangement reactions have relied on the use of electrophilic atom-transfer reagents to generate bridged cationic intermediates as the first Received: March 21, 2023 Published: July 10, 2023 step in the 1,2-ring expansion process.9,10 The few examples of enantioselective protio-semipinacol rearrangement methods that have been reported to date rely on substrates that undergo protonation to generate heteroatom-stabilized cationic inter-mediates.11,12 This substrate limitation likely results from the challenges associated with generating and controlling the stereoselectivity of high-energy intermediates.13 Given that chiral HBD catalysts have been demonstrated to induce high levels of enantiocontrol through networks of attractive noncovalent interactions in reactions proceeding through ionic mechanisms,14 we considered whether the cooperative effect of an HBD with HCl may generate a chiral environment amenable to an enantioselective protio-semipinacol ring-expansion process that does not require heteroatom stabiliza-tion of the cationic intermediate. Here we describe the successful application of chiral HBD/HCl cocatalysis to the enantioselective isomerization of vinylic tertiary cyclopropyl alcohol substrates in semipinacol 1,2-ring-expansion reactions. The resulting method provides a versatile platform for accessing highly enantioenriched cyclobutanone products bearing α-quaternary centers. Our studies on the cocatalytic effect of HCl and chiral HBDs in protio-semipinacol rearrangements were initiated using phenyl-substituted vinylic cyclopropyl alcohol 1a as a model substrate. Drawing on prior work on the activation of aldehydes toward Prins cyclization reactions,8 we found that thiourea derivative 2a (10 mol %) and an ethereal solution of hydrochloric acid (5 mol %) in toluene promoted the isomerization of 1a to the ring-expanded cyclobutanone 3a in 97% yield with 83% ee (Table 1, entry 1). Extensive variation of the structure and nature of the chiral dual HBD cocatalyst revealed the best results for compounds with the general structure in 2 but a surprisingly flat enantioselectivity landscape within that family of catalysts (see SI sections 2.3 and 13). For example, replacement of the thiourea moiety with a urea as in 2b had little effect on the enantioselectivity (entry 2); however, the urea catalyst was found to be more stable toward the strongly acidic reaction conditions, avoiding Edman degradation pathways.15 The carbazole-containing urea 2c imparted the highest enantioselectivities of all catalysts tested, affording the ring-expanded cyclobutanone product in 88% yield with 92% ee (entry 3). Aromatic solvents such as toluene were found to be essential for good reactivity (entry 4), while the reaction performance was relatively insensitive to changes in temperature or concentration (entries 5 and 6). Optimal levels of enantioselectivity could be attained with different HCl/HBD ratios as long as [HCl] does not exceed that of the chiral catalyst (entries 7 and 8).16 The reaction conditions identified as optimal for the highly enantioselective catalytic rearrangement of 1a were applied to a series of other styrenylcyclopropyl alcohol substates (Figure 2). Variations of the aryl component were generally well-tolerated (3c-3h), although products bearing strongly electron-donating (3b) or -withdrawing (3m) substituents were generated with lower enantioselectivities. Extension to nonconjugated alkyl-substituted vinylic cyclopropyl alcohol derivatives also proved possible, with excellent levels of enantiocontrol achieved with substrates bearing cyclohexyl, adamantyl, neopentyl, and tert-butyl substituents (3i-3l). However, limitations were encountered, with the conforma-tionally flexible phenethyl derivative 3n generated in high yield but modest enantioselectivity (53% ee). More highly substituted alkenyl derivatives (e.g., 1o) and vinylic cyclo-butanols (e.g., 1p) proved to be unreactive under the cocatalytic conditions tested. With quite general access to cyclobutanone products bearing α-quaternary stereocenters in hand, we sought to expand the utility of the products in a series of synthetic elaborations (Figure 3).17 The model cyclobutanone 3a was found to undergo completely stereospecific ring expansion under standard Baeyer-Villiger oxidation conditions to provide γ-lactone 4a in excellent yield. Whereas ketone reduction with NaBH4 proceeded with high relative stereoselectivity to afford cyclobutanol 5a in a 12.8:1 ratio of diastereomers, other nucleophilic addition reactions proved to be less diastereose-lective. For instance, the addition of vinyl Grignard to 3a afforded a 3.4:1 ratio of separable diastereomers (6a and 6b), and reductive amination provided benzylamine derivatives 7 as a 3.8:1 mixture. In every case, the major diastereomer was found to correspond to the product in which the nucleophilic addition occurred to the same face as the phenyl group.18 This seemingly counterintuitive sense of relative stereoinduction is readily rationalized based on the conformational preferences of 3a, which place the methyl substituent in a pseudoaxial position and minimize the steric effects of the phenyl group (see SI section 11.5 for computed conformers). As a synthetic method, this asymmetric proto-semipinacol protocol affords a variety of readily elaborated cyclobutanones bearing α-quaternary stereocenters from vinylic cyclopropanol substrates. From a fundamental standpoint, the high levels of enantioselectivity achieved in these reactions raise the interesting question of how such high levels of chiral catalyst control (ΔΔG⧧ up to 2.1 kcal/mol at 4 °C) can be achieved in 1,2-ring expansion processes anticipated to have barriers below 6 kcal/mol.19 To gain insight into the mechanism of catalysis and stereoinduction in the HBD-HCl cocatalytic reaction, we undertook a mechanistic investigation using a series of experimental and computational techniques. In principle, the protio-semipinacol rearrangement reaction could proceed through either a concerted or stepwise reaction mechanism (Figure 4A). In a concerted mechanism, alkene protonation would be accompanied by C-C bond migration in a single step, whereas the distinguishing feature of a stepwise mechanism would be the intermediacy of a discrete carbocation formed via initial protonation of the alkene. Within the stepwise manifold, either the protonation or ring-expansion step could be rate-or enantiodetermining. As the distinguishing feature between the concerted and stepwise mechanisms is the formation of a discrete carbocation, we conducted a Hammett study to assess the degree of charge development in the product-committing step.20 The log of relative reaction rates for styrenylcyclopropyl alcohol substrates bearing different para substituents correlated extremely well with the Hammett σ parameter (R2 = 0.997), affording a ρ value of -2.67 (Figure 4B). The magnitude of the ρ value is fully consistent with prior reports describing the generation of discrete benzyl cyclopropylcarbinyl carboca-tions.21 The better correlation with the σ parameter instead of σ+ (Figures S2 and S3) suggests that the aryl group is not fully conjugated with the alkene, a possibility reinforced by the comparable reaction rates observed with aryl-and alkyl-substituted vinylic cyclopropanols. While this correlation is most consistent with a stepwise process where protonation of the alkene is rate-determining, a highly asynchronous concerted mechanism could not be ruled out entirely on the basis of these data alone. Further support for the stepwise nature of the rearrangement reaction was gleaned from heavy-atom kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies. We reasoned that if protonation of the alkene is the rate-determining step, the migrating carbon would be minimally affected, and no primary KIE would be expected. Alternatively, if ring expansion is part of the rate-determining span (such as in a concerted asynchronous process or a stepwise process with rate-limiting ring expansion), a diagnostic primary KIE (computed to be 1.022; see SI section 11.3) would be predicted on the migrating carbon (Figure 4C). The 12C/13C isotope effects were determined using natural-abundance 1a and the recently developed polarization-transfer methodology to enhance the 13C signals.22 We observed negligible isotope effects on the cyclobutanone carbons that arise from the cyclopropane but a distinctive isotope effect on the product methyl group (Figure 4C), closely matching those predicted for a reaction pathway where protonation is rate-determining. While the experimental data outlined above provide compelling evidence that the semipinacol rearrangement reaction proceeds through a stepwise pathway with rate-limiting protonation, in principle either or both of the steps in that mechanism might be enantiodetermining. If skeletal rearrangement from a discrete cationic intermediate (TS‡-3 in Figure 4A) is fully enantiodetermining, then identical enantioselectivity should be obtained for the different alkene isomers that undergo the protio-semipinacol rearrangement via the same carbocation. To test this possibility, the isomeric alkenyl cyclopropyl alcohols 1k and 8k were subjected separately to cocatalytic reaction conditions (C6D6, 22 °C). The cyclobutanone product 3k was obtained with substantially different ee values (Figure 4D), suggesting that the carbocationic intermediate remains catalyst-bound and does not fully equilibrate to render these two intermediates identical. While this result precludes ring expansion from a fully equilibrated, discrete carbocation as the selectivity-determining step, either protonation or ring expansion from a catalyst-bound intermediate could still be enantiodetermin-ing. These investigations expand the concept of cocatalysis between strong achiral Brønsted acids and chiral HBDs beyond activation of heteroatom-containing functional groups. The disclosed protio-semipinacol rearrangement reaction provides access to highly enantioenriched cyclobutanones bearing α-quaternary stereocenters. Through a series of physical-organic experiments (linear free energy relationship studies, 12C/13C KIEs), we elucidate a stepwise reaction pathway where protonation of the alkene in the cyclopropyl alcohol substrate is rate-determining but in principle either or both steps could be enantiodetermining. The intriguing question of how such high levels of enantioinduction can be achieved in reactions involving short-lived reactive intermediates is the topic of continuing studies.

        "Dual-Hydrogen-Bond Donor and Brønsted Acid Cocatalysis Enables Highly Enantioselective Protio-Semipinacol Rearrangement Reactions",
        "Melanie A. S. Blackburn, Corin C. Wagen, M. Raul Bodrogean, Pamela M. Tadross, Andrew J. Bendelsmith, Dennis A. Kutateladze, and Eric N. Jacobsen*Cite This: J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 15036-15042 Read OnlineABSTRACT: A catalytic protio-semipinacol ring-expansion reaction has been developed for the highly enantioselective conversion of tertiary vinylic cyclopropyl alcohols into cyclobutanone products bearing α-quaternary stereogenic centers. The method relies on the cocatalytic effect of a chiral dual-hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) with hydrogen chloride. Experimental evidence is provided for a stepwise mechanism where protonation of the alkene generates a short-lived, high-energy carbocation, which is followed by C-C bond migration to deliver the enantioenriched product. This research applies strong acid/chiral HBD cocatalysis to weakly basic olefinic substrates and lays the foundation for further investigations of enantioselective reactions involving high-energy cationic intermediates.",
        "acid catalysis holds unique importance as areactivity principle in both chemical and biologicalsynthesis. In recent years, significant effort has been focused on controlling absolute stereochemical outcomes in acid-catalyzed reactions, with a primary approach involving the design and implementation of small-molecule chiral Brønsted acids.1,2 A broad array of highly effective chiral catalysts of varying acidity have been identified, enabling the development of numerous important organic transformations with high enantioselectivity.3 In this regard, particular success has been achieved in reactions engaging substrates bearing basic functional groups such as imines.2,4 Extension of these systems to less basic substrate classes remains challenging, though noteworthy advances have been achieved recently for enantioselective reactions involving activation of carbonyl groups5 or simple olefins.6A complementary approach to asymmetric catalysis in reactions requiring substrate activation with strong Brønsted acids involves engaging neutral, chiral anion-binding catalysts capable of associating with the conjugate bases of achiral mineral acids. This strategy offers the potential to access chiral variants of Brønsted acids possessing an essentially unlimited range of acidities. To this end, chiral dual-hydrogen-bond donors (HBDs) have been utilized to impart enantioselectivity in transformations of imines and carbonyl compounds promoted by sulfonic acids or HCl (Figure 1A).7,8 We sought to determine whether this cocatalysis concept could be extended to reaction of olefins that upon protonation generate carbocationic intermediates lacking heteroatom stabilization, focusing on the specific case of protio-semipinacol 1,2-ring-expansion processes (Figure 1B).",
        "Traditionally, enantioselective semipinacol rearrangement reactions have relied on the use of electrophilic atom-transfer reagents to generate bridged cationic intermediates as the first Received: March 21, 2023 Published: July 10, 2023step in the 1,2-ring expansion process.9,10 The few examples of enantioselective protio-semipinacol rearrangement methods that have been reported to date rely on substrates that undergo protonation to generate heteroatom-stabilized cationic inter-mediates.11,12 This substrate limitation likely results from the challenges associated with generating and controlling the stereoselectivity of high-energy intermediates.13 Given that chiral HBD catalysts have been demonstrated to induce high levels of enantiocontrol through networks of attractive noncovalent interactions in reactions proceeding through ionic mechanisms,14 we considered whether the cooperative effect of an HBD with HCl may generate a chiral environment amenable to an enantioselective protio-semipinacol ring-expansion process that does not require heteroatom stabiliza-tion of the cationic intermediate. Here we describe the successful application of chiral HBD/HCl cocatalysis to the enantioselective isomerization of vinylic tertiary cyclopropyl alcohol substrates in semipinacol 1,2-ring-expansion reactions. The resulting method provides a versatile platform for accessing highly enantioenriched cyclobutanone products bearing α-quaternary centers.",
        "Our studies on the cocatalytic effect of HCl and chiral HBDs in protio-semipinacol rearrangements were initiated using phenyl-substituted vinylic cyclopropyl alcohol 1a as a model substrate. Drawing on prior work on the activation of aldehydes toward Prins cyclization reactions,8 we found that thiourea derivative 2a (10 mol %) and an ethereal solution of hydrochloric acid (5 mol %) in toluene promoted the isomerization of 1a to the ring-expanded cyclobutanone 3a in 97% yield with 83% ee (Table 1, entry 1). Extensive variation of the structure and nature of the chiral dual HBD cocatalyst revealed the best results for compounds with the general structure in 2 but a surprisingly flat enantioselectivity landscape within that family of catalysts (see SI sections 2.3 and 13). For example, replacement of the thiourea moiety with a urea as in 2b had little effect on the enantioselectivity (entry 2); however, the urea catalyst was found to be more stable toward the strongly acidic reaction conditions, avoiding Edman degradation pathways.15 The carbazole-containing urea 2c imparted the highest enantioselectivities of all catalysts tested, affording the ring-expanded cyclobutanone product in 88% yield with 92% ee (entry 3). Aromatic solvents such as toluene were found to be essential for good reactivity (entry 4), while the reaction performance was relatively insensitive to changes in temperature or concentration (entries 5 and 6). Optimal levels of enantioselectivity could be attained with different HCl/HBD ratios as long as [HCl] does not exceed that of the chiral catalyst (entries 7 and 8).16The reaction conditions identified as optimal for the highly enantioselective catalytic rearrangement of 1a were applied to a series of other styrenylcyclopropyl alcohol substates (Figure 2). Variations of the aryl component were generally well-tolerated (3c-3h), although products bearing strongly electron-donating (3b) or -withdrawing (3m) substituents were generated with lower enantioselectivities. Extension to nonconjugated alkyl-substituted vinylic cyclopropyl alcohol derivatives also proved possible, with excellent levels of enantiocontrol achieved with substrates bearing cyclohexyl, adamantyl, neopentyl, and tert-butyl substituents (3i-3l). However, limitations were encountered, with the conforma-tionally flexible phenethyl derivative 3n generated in high yield but modest enantioselectivity (53% ee). More highly substituted alkenyl derivatives (e.g., 1o) and vinylic cyclo-butanols (e.g., 1p) proved to be unreactive under the cocatalytic conditions tested.",
        "With quite general access to cyclobutanone products bearing α-quaternary stereocenters in hand, we sought to expand the utility of the products in a series of synthetic elaborations (Figure 3).17 The model cyclobutanone 3a was found to undergo completely stereospecific ring expansion under standard Baeyer-Villiger oxidation conditions to provide γ-lactone 4a in excellent yield. Whereas ketone reduction with NaBH4 proceeded with high relative stereoselectivity to afford cyclobutanol 5a in a 12.8:1 ratio of diastereomers, other nucleophilic addition reactions proved to be less diastereose-lective. For instance, the addition of vinyl Grignard to 3a afforded a 3.4:1 ratio of separable diastereomers (6a and 6b), and reductive amination provided benzylamine derivatives 7 as a 3.8:1 mixture. In every case, the major diastereomer was found to correspond to the product in which the nucleophilic addition occurred to the same face as the phenyl group.18 This seemingly counterintuitive sense of relative stereoinduction is readily rationalized based on the conformational preferences of 3a, which place the methyl substituent in a pseudoaxial position and minimize the steric effects of the phenyl group (see SI section 11.5 for computed conformers).",
        "As a synthetic method, this asymmetric proto-semipinacol protocol affords a variety of readily elaborated cyclobutanones bearing α-quaternary stereocenters from vinylic cyclopropanol substrates. From a fundamental standpoint, the high levels of enantioselectivity achieved in these reactions raise the interesting question of how such high levels of chiral catalyst control (ΔΔG⧧ up to 2.1 kcal/mol at 4 °C) can be achieved in 1,2-ring expansion processes anticipated to have barriers below 6 kcal/mol.19 To gain insight into the mechanism of catalysis and stereoinduction in the HBD-HCl cocatalytic reaction, weundertook a mechanistic investigation using a series of experimental and computational techniques.",
        "In principle, the protio-semipinacol rearrangement reaction could proceed through either a concerted or stepwise reaction mechanism (Figure 4A). In a concerted mechanism, alkene protonation would be accompanied by C-C bond migration in a single step, whereas the distinguishing feature of a stepwise mechanism would be the intermediacy of a discrete carbocation formed via initial protonation of the alkene. Within the stepwise manifold, either the protonation or ring-expansion step could be rate-or enantiodetermining.",
        "As the distinguishing feature between the concerted and stepwise mechanisms is the formation of a discrete carbocation, we conducted a Hammett study to assess the degree of charge development in the product-committing step.20 The log of relative reaction rates for styrenylcyclopropyl alcohol substrates bearing different para substituents correlated extremely well with the Hammett σ parameter (R2 = 0.997), affording a ρ value of -2.67 (Figure 4B). The magnitude of the ρ value is fully consistent with prior reports describing the generation of discrete benzyl cyclopropylcarbinyl carboca-tions.21 The better correlation with the σ parameter instead of σ+ (Figures S2 and S3) suggests that the aryl group is not fully conjugated with the alkene, a possibility reinforced by the comparable reaction rates observed with aryl-and alkyl-substituted vinylic cyclopropanols. While this correlation is most consistent with a stepwise process where protonation of the alkene is rate-determining, a highly asynchronous concerted mechanism could not be ruled out entirely on the basis of these data alone.",
        "Further support for the stepwise nature of the rearrangement reaction was gleaned from heavy-atom kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies. We reasoned that if protonation of the alkene is the rate-determining step, the migrating carbon would be minimally affected, and no primary KIE would be expected. Alternatively, if ring expansion is part of the rate-determining span (such as in a concerted asynchronous process or a stepwise process with rate-limiting ring expansion), a diagnostic primary KIE (computed to be 1.022; see SI section 11.3) would be predicted on the migrating carbon (Figure 4C). The 12C/13C isotope effects were determined using natural-abundance 1a and the recently developed polarization-transfer methodology to enhance the 13C signals.22 We observed negligible isotope effects on the cyclobutanone carbons that arise from the cyclopropane but a distinctive isotope effect on the product methyl group (Figure 4C), closely matching those predicted for a reaction pathway where protonation is rate-determining.",
        "While the experimental data outlined above provide compelling evidence that the semipinacol rearrangement reaction proceeds through a stepwise pathway with rate-limiting protonation, in principle either or both of the steps in that mechanism might be enantiodetermining. If skeletal rearrangement from a discrete cationic intermediate (TS‡-3 in Figure 4A) is fully enantiodetermining, then identical enantioselectivity should be obtained for the different alkene isomers that undergo the protio-semipinacol rearrangement via the same carbocation. To test this possibility, the isomeric alkenyl cyclopropyl alcohols 1k and 8k were subjected separately to cocatalytic reaction conditions (C6D6, 22 °C). The cyclobutanone product 3k was obtained with substantially different ee values (Figure 4D), suggesting that the carbocationic intermediate remains catalyst-bound and does not fully equilibrate to render these two intermediates identical. While this result precludes ring expansion from a fully equilibrated, discrete carbocation as the selectivity-determining step, either protonation or ring expansion from a catalyst-bound intermediate could still be enantiodetermin-ing.",
        "These investigations expand the concept of cocatalysis between strong achiral Brønsted acids and chiral HBDs beyond activation of heteroatom-containing functional groups. The disclosed protio-semipinacol rearrangement reaction provides access to highly enantioenriched cyclobutanones bearing α-quaternary stereocenters. Through a series of physical-organic experiments (linear free energy relationship studies, 12C/13C KIEs), we elucidate a stepwise reaction pathway where protonation of the alkene in the cyclopropyl alcohol substrate is rate-determining but in principle either or both steps could be enantiodetermining. The intriguing question of how such high levels of enantioinduction can be achieved in reactions involving short-lived reactive intermediates is the topic of continuing studies.",
