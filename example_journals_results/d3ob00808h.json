Both keti-mines and aldimines are applicable to this transformation. Various 1,2-diamines with different functional groups were produced in moderate to excellent yields. Moreover, this approach could be performed on a gram scale, showing its practicality. Introduction The structural moieties of 1,2-diamines have broad appli-cations in the fields of medicine and synthetic chemistry,1,2 such as in anti-cancer drugs (e.g. spermine3 and (-)-agelastatin A4) and antiviral drugs (e.g. Tamiflu5), and as auxiliary ligands6 and as chiral catalysts7,8 in asymmetric synthesis. The synthesis of 1,2-diamines has attracted much attention in syn-thetic chemistry, and several methods have been reported such as the classical representative Mannich reactions.9–13 However, due to the involvement of the harsh conditions of low temperatures,9–13 stoichiometric amounts of metals14 and dangerous reagents such as triethyl boron15 in these reactions, the exploration of mild strategies is essential. Recent advances have been made to make up for these deficiencies; for example, Wickens reported an electrochemical one-pot unsym-metrical diamination reaction16 (Scheme 1a). Apart from electrocatalysis, visible-light-mediated construc-tion of C–C bonds17–20 has also become prominent as a mild strategy in recent years. In this context, the direct functionali-zation of C–H bonds21–24 of tertiary amines has been strategi-cally implemented for constructing C–C bonds under visible light irradiation. There are many elegant protocols25–29 for acti-vating the C–H bonds of tertiary amines, such as visible-light-mediated reactions with electron-deficient olefins,30–33 malei-mides,34 α,β-unsaturated amides,35 esters,36 and imines. The α-amino alkylation reactions of imines, in particular, are applicable to preparing 1,2-diamines. Ooi successfully rea-lized the asymmetric coupling of secondary α-amino radical anions and N-arylaminomethanes to prepare chiral 1,2-dia-mines37 (Scheme 1b). Rueping’s group developed a visible-light-mediated approach for the α-amino alkylation of aldimines, the radical coupling reaction of ionic radicals produced by tertiary amines with imines and aldehydes.38 Besides, Paixão and co-workers expanded the range of radical α-amino alkylations toward azomethine iminium ions.39 In addition, Singh successfully prepared α,β-diamino esters using N,N-dimethylbenzamine and glyoxal oxime ether as substrates.40 Given that 3-aminooxindoles bearing a stereo carbon center at the 3-position are valuable in the biomedical field,41 herein we report a protocol for the α-amino alkylation of isatin-derived ketimines with tertiary amines under visible light irradiation to prepare 1,2-diamines (Scheme 1c). Results and discussion Initially, 1-methyl-3-(phenylimino)indolin-2-one 1a and 4,N,N-trimethylaniline 2a were selected as the model substrates to screen the conditions of this reaction (Table 1). Firstly, this reaction was carried out with 1a and 2a in the presence of the photocatalyst Ru(bpy)3Cl2 in MeCN under the irradiation of a 30 W blue LED lamp at room temperature for 24 h. To our delight, the desired product 3aa was obtained in 43% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Subsequently, other photocata-lysts, such as 4CzIPN, Ir(ppy)3 and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2, were employed, and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 was the best one (Table 1, entries 2–4). Unlike previous relevant reports,39,40 adding a basic additive such as NaOAc was detrimental to this reaction (Table 1, entry 5). Nevertheless, the presence of Brønsted acid benefited the reaction (Table 1, entries 6 and 7), and the effect of PhCOOH was superior to that of CF3COOH. Furthermore, MeCN was the ideal solvent for this transformation (Table 1, entries 7–9). Moreover, the yield was improved up to 83% by increasing the amount of [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 and PhCOOH (Table 1, entry 10). In addition, control experiments confirmed that a photo-catalyst and visible light were essential in this protocol (Table 1, entries 11 and 12). Besides, in the radical quenching experiment with the addition of TEMPO, 3aa could not be detected (Table 1, entry 13). Under the optimal conditions, the scope of the α-amino alkylation process was investigated. When the substituents on the N-aryl of ketimines were varied, substrates with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups reacted smoothly with 4,N,N-trimethylaniline 2a, resulting in moderate to excel-lent yields (Table 2, 3aa–3ea and 3ga–3la). The substituents at the ortho position influenced this system due to their close location to the reaction site, and enhanced the steric hin-drance that existed for the substrates (Table 2, 3ca and 3ea). Unfortunately, when the cyano group was at the para posi-tion of N-aryl, only a trace amount of product 3fa was detected. It might be that the strong electron-withdrawing effect decreased the density of the electron of imines, which had a negative impact on the protonation process (Scheme 3). Besides, substrates with two substituents of the ketimines were also converted into the corresponding products 3ja and 3ka in moderate yields. The lower yields were likely due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the isatin ketimines 1j and 1k. In addition, the substituents on the nitrogen atom in isatin had little effect on this reaction, for example, isatin ketimines with N-Et/n-Bu groups were transformed in good yields (Table 2, 3ma and 3na). Moreover, we tested the N,N-dimethyl-benzamine analogs with the methoxy group and chlorine group at the para position of the aryl ring, respectively, and obtained the target products in good yields (Table 2, 3ab and 3ac). In addition, unsymmetrical anilines were tested; however, only trace amounts of 3ad were detected and 3ae was not detected (Table 2, 3ad and 3ae). In order to further explore the application scope, the α-amino alkylation of N-sulfonyl aldimines was also realized (see the ESI† for more details). On the basis of the optimized conditions, the scope of N-sulfonyl aldimines was evaluated by using 4,N,N-trimethylaniline 2a as well (Table 3). N-Sulfonyl aldimines with various substituents, irrespective of their sub-stitution patterns and electronic properties, were smoothly converted into the corresponding 1,2-diamines 5. The alkyl, methoxy and halogenated groups of aromatic N-sulfonyl aldi-mines were competent partners, and gave the corresponding products in good yields (Table 3, 5aa–5ga and 5ia and5ka). Significantly, the substrate with multi-substituents of methoxy groups was transformed into the desired product 5ga in an excellent yield due to the enhanced electron-donating effect. Gratifyingly, this approach could be extended to polyaromatic aldimines, leading to 5ha in 75% yield. A moderate yield was obtained for 5la with the influence of cyano group at benzene ring (Table 3, 5la), which was similar to the 3fa. Likewise, when the Ms group was replaced with the Ts group at the nitrogen atom, the corresponding product 5ma was obtained in a moderate yield. We also attempted to replace the phenyl group of the aldimine with other heterocycles, such as the pyri-dine ring, but no target product (5na) was detected. Moreover, we further evaluated the para-substituted dimethylaniline derivatives with the methoxy and chlorine groups, which pre-sented good yields (Table 3, 5ab and 5ac). In order to investigate the practical potential of this approach, gram scale syntheses of 3aa and 5aa were performed under the optimal conditions, respectively (Scheme 2). When 4.24 mmol of 1a and 5.08 mmol of 4a were alkylated, respectively, with 2a under the optimal conditions, good yields of 3aa (72%, 1.13 g) and 5aa (79%, 1.33 g) were obtained (see the ESI† for more details). The gram-scale synthesis of 1,2-dia-mines showed the practicality of the α-amino alkylations of both ketimines and aldimines. The reaction mechanism we forecasted is shown in Scheme 3. To gain further insight into the mechanism, we used TEMPO to perform radical quenching experiments by using 1a and 2a and 4a and 2a as substrates, respectively. The target products 3aa and 5aa were not detected (Table 1, entry 13), with 85% of ketimine 1a and 80% of aldimine 4a being recovered, thus indicating that radical processes took place. Besides, fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that 2a could lead to fluorescence quenching. Based on our research studies and related reports,38,39 we proposed that these radical alkylation reactions could proceed through two plausible mechanisms: (A) the mechanism of radical addition and (B) the mechanism of radical–radical coupling (Scheme 3). As shown in Scheme 3, in pathway A, the excited-state photocatalyst *Ru(bpy)3 2+ species can oxidize 2 to produce the radical species 6. The radical species 6 undergoes direct addition to imine 1 or 4 to give the N-centered radical species 7. Then, with the assistance of protons, the radical species 7 is reduced by Ru(bpy)+ to give the final 1,2-diamine 3 or 5 with the regeneration of Ru(bpy)3 2+. In pathway B, after producing the radical species 6 similarly, imine 1 or 4 is reduced by Ru (bpy)3 + with the assistance of protons to give the radical species 8. And the final product 3 or 5 is produced by the coupling of radical species 8 with radical species 6. Given that the pathway A is a radical propagation process, which is more advantageous than the pathway B. Therefore, pathway A might be the primary route and pathway B is a limited secondary process. Pathway B can’t be ruled out completely at present. Conclusions In conclusion, a mild, scalable, and efficient method has been developed for the α-amino alkylation of isatin-derived keti-mines with N,N-dimethylanilines. In particular, this method is also applicable to N-sulfonyl aldimines. Based on the photo-redox/Brønsted acid co-catalyzed strategy, a wide range of func-tional groups are tolerated in this method. A series of 1,2-dia-mines are produced in up to 92% yields under visible light irradiation. Moreover, this method can be performed on a gram scale, providing more prospects and diversity for the syn-thesis of 1,2-diamines. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare.
