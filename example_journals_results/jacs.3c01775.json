Understanding site-resolved cholesterol structural dynamics is thus important. This long-standing challenge has thus far been addressed, in part, by selective isotopic labeling approaches. Here we present a new 3D solid-state NMR (SSNMR) experiment utilizing scalar 13C-13C polarization transfer and recoupling of the 1H-13C interactions in order to determine average dipolar couplings for all 1H-13C vectors in uniformly 13C-enriched cholesterol. The experimentally determined order parameters (OP) agree exceptionally well with molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories and reveal coupling among several conformational degrees of freedom in cholesterol molecules. Quantum chemistry shielding calculations further support this conclusion and specifically demonstrate that ring tilt and rotation are coupled to changes in tail conformation and that these coupled segmental dynamics dictate the orientation of cholesterol. These findings advance our understanding of physiologically relevant dynamics of cholesterol, and the methods that revealed them have broader potential to characterize how structural dynamics of other small molecules impact their biological functions. Coupled structural dynamics play a critical role in proteinfunction,1-3 and advances in understanding such phenomena reveal new opportunities for next generation rational drug design.4,5 Similar dynamics likely also play a role in the functions of many biologically active small molecules.6 But this area has been relatively underdeveloped, and tools for interrogating small molecule dynamics in biologically relevant settings are lacking. These limitations are reflected in the longstanding challenge of understanding the dynamics of cholesterol (Chol) (Figure 1E), one of the most important small molecules in mammalian physiology. Chol is also very important in human medicine. High levels increase the risk of heart disease, and cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors can mitigate these risks.7-9 Dose-limiting renal toxicity of the clinically vital antifungal drug amphotericin B (AmB) requires cholesterol binding,10,11,14 and AmB analogs with greater selectivity for binding ergosterol relative to Chol have improved therapeutic indices in preclinical studies.12,13 Chol also plays an important role in the capacity of AmB ion channels to serve as molecular prosthetics for missing or dysfunctional CFTR anion channels. Chol also plays a key role in viral infectivity; for example, HIV fusion peptides preferentially target Chol-rich membrane regions.14 Chol interactions with proteins such as α-synuclein15 and β-amyloid16 are postulated to be critical to regulation of protein aggregation in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.16,17 Chol dynamics in living systems have been the subject of intense study, but insights have been slow to emerge. Sterol lateral mobility has been studied by fluorescence microscopy, but these studies are limited by the potential artifactual effects of the chemical modifications. Experiments combining site-specific deuterium (2H) labeling with SSNMR spectroscopy can measure the magnitude and time scale of molecular motions in phospholipid bilayers. These properties are reported in OP18-21 and quadrupolar relaxation rates,22 respectively, and are used to quantify Chol modulation of membrane fluidity as a function of composition and temper-ature.23 A 2H SSNMR spectroscopy-based study demonstrated that the acyclic aliphatic tail, but not the fused tetracyclic core, of Chol contributes to membrane condensation.24 Intermo-lecular 13C-19F REDOR distances identified the Chol-binding motifs in M2 underlying the mechanism of membrane scission in budding virus cells.25 These studies are currently limited in both efficiency and resolution due to their dependence on site-specific labeling. A roadmap for addressing these limitations has been laid in recent studies of the structures and dynamics of membrane and fibrous proteins, leveraging combined uniform isotopic enrich-ment, high magnetic fields, and state-of-the-art SSNMR methods.26-33 These powerful strategies have been proven useful for more illuminating functionally relevant interactions of Chol with membrane proteins.34-36 Here we employed a combination of uniformly labeled Chol (U-13C-Chol), new 3D SSNMR experiments that utilize scalar 13C-13C polarization transfer and recoupling of the 1H-13C interactions to determine average dipolar couplings for all 1H-13C vectors, and multilevel theory including all-atom MD simulations and QM calculations to illuminate the structure and dynamics of Chol in membrane with heightened resolution.

We first attempted to measure the 1H-13C dipolar couplings using a fully dipolar 3D R-symmetry37,38 experiment (Figure 1A), which recouples heteronuclear but decouples homonu-clear couplings. The SSNMR experiments place the chemical shifts of the 13C-13C correlation into the ω1-ω3 dimensions and the C-H dipolar coupling in the ω2 dimension and correspond to the C-H dipolar coupling of the 13C site along the ω1 axis. We used 1H-13C cross-polarization (CP) and 13C-13C SPCn mixing39 to achieve signal enhancement and dipolar mixing, respectively. The resulting CP-SPCn-RNnv 3D spectrum exhibited some surprising spectral features. First, several one-bond correlations are missing. For example, the 2D SPCn spectrum in Figure 1B lacks correlations between C11-C9 and C8-C9. Second, several peaks are asymmetric across the diagonal, such as C25-C26 and C9-C10. Third, for several sites the two-bond correlations are stronger than one-bond correlations. For example, it is particularly striking in Figure 1B how weak the C2-C3 and C4-C3 correlations are compared to other one-bond correlations. Having precisely assessed the site-specific 13C-labeling percentages previously,40 we focus our attention on the spectroscopic origins of these surprising results. A major advantage of 3D SSNMR is that each data set contains an abundance of internal controls to confirm that the experiment and sample remain stable throughout data collection. For Chol, multiple peaks report on the same heteronuclear dipolar coupling; e.g, the C9-C9, C8-C9, C10-C9, and C11-C9 (ω1-ω3) cross-and autocorrelation peaks all report on (multiple) 1H-13C dipolar couplings to the C9 site, and the (in)consistency of the obtained OP (in)validates the resulting interpretation. The fully dipolar experiment yielded systematic differences in the dipolar line shape data (Figure 1C) and the fitted OP (Figure 1D). Extreme examples of this�where the dipolar vectors lie near the magic angle relative to the motional axis, such as C11-C9 and C8-C9�show nearly complete averaging of the couplings and therefore peaks with marginal signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios. We hypothesized that the differences among these sites, both in the data quality and resulting fits, arose due to the orientational dependence of the 1H-13C and 13C-13C dipolar couplings responsible for transferring polarization to each 13C site in ω1-ω3 respectively. If correct, such effects can be a powerful way to probe the molecular orientation. To test this hypothesis, we interrogated if these effects on the hetero-nuclear dipolar coupling measurements would be negated if we implemented a direct polarization (DP) COSY R-symmetry or fully scalar (through-bond) scheme. We developed a version of the pulse sequence comprising 13C DP followed by polar-ization transfer using the CTUC-COSY mixing scheme,41 followed by the same type of R-symmetry heteronuclear recoupling (Figure 2A).42 The spectrum derived from this DP-COSY-RNnv sequence has sensitivity higher than that of the CP-SPCn-RNnv dipolar version and reports only on the one-bond correlations under the conditions employed here. Supporting our hypothesis, the DP-COSY-RNnv experiment yielded consistent OP derived from all correlations (Figure 2C, 2D), including those of C9 where the C8-C9 and C11-C9 peaks were absent from the fully dipolar spectrum. Multiple OP determinations from the same spectrum increased the robustness and precision of these measurements, and we thus obtained a highly confident experimental OP for the entire Chol molecule. The OP obtained from MD simulations (Figure 3A) of Chol in a POPC membrane (Figure 3B) agreed with the experimental data (Figures 3C, S3), enabling interrogation of the results of the MD. We expand upon the agreement of SSNMR to MD OP in the supplementary text. In addition to the extraction of OP which report on the rotational motion of a bond vector, temporal and spatial resolution of all-atom MD simulations enabled reporting on the dynamic chemical environment of membranous Chol.21,24 Our MD simulations revealed the preferred conformations sampled by the Chol tails (Figure 4). We define the five tail dihedral angles φ1-φ5 (Figures 4A, S5), and as expected, φ1 mostly samples the gauche conformation (Figure 4A), to minimize the steric clash that occurs between the C21 and C18 methyl groups. On the other hand, the φ5 is equally sampling the gauche and trans conformations, in agreement with the single peak for C26 and C27 in the NMR spectrum. The other dihedral angles primarily adopt trans conformations. These findings agree with previous computational studies,21,24 and our calculated CS distributions agree with SSNMR-measured shifts (Figures S4, S6, S7). We examined the CS agreement using the RMSD between the SSNMR and MD-based QM by gradually increasing the xtxxx population of φ1-φ5 angles from 0% to 100%, in the background of the xgxxx population, where x is either gauche or trans (Figure 4B). The experimental and calculated CS as a function of φ2 conformation revealed that, for the best agreement, ∼70% of the Chol tails have to be in a trans φ2 dihedral conformation in POPC membranes in the liquid phase. Remarkably, our approach provided insight into the preferred conformations of the Chol tails in the SSNMR sample. By this metric, our MD simulations agree well with the experimental data, as a larger portion of the Chols (61%) had a trans φ2 conformation which is within the accuracy of this study (Figure 4B). We suggest that the approach outlined here in principle can be used for future improvements in force fields. We then used the MD of tail dihedral angles and Chol tilt and rotation to gain insights into the Chol dynamics within the membrane. Using cross-correlation analysis of tail dihedral angles and molecular motions (see Table S1) we revealed coupled dynamics of membranous Chol. Specifically, there are significant correlations between φ2 and both the tilt angle and axial rotation of Chol as well as anticorrelation between the latter (Figures 4C, S8-S9). Our approach also shows that, as expected from their geometry, the dynamics of the highly mobile φ4 and φ5 are positively correlated, and importantly, the strength of their coupling, 0.33 (Figure 4E), can serve as a basis for comparison for other values. The Chol dynamics and that of its tail are correlated, as φ2 influences the rotation and tilt of the whole molecule. Appropriately, the MD lifetimes of these three processes are similar (Figure S11). Intriguingly, a previous computational study45 suggested the importance of the C21 methyl group, the node between φ1 and φ2, in maintaining optimal Chol tilt. Further analysis of the tail dihedral angles using a Markov model revealed that a direct gauche to trans transition of φ2 was rarely observed in simulations and that a plausible pathway needs to involve changes in dihedral angles downstream of φ2�in a “crankshaft manner” (Figure S11, Table S2). The direct transition from gauche to trans for φ2 may require a large motion of the tail while in close proximity to lipid tails as well as neighboring Chol46 molecules. In fact, in agreement with a recent study,47 our MD simulations also revealed formation of Chol oligomers (Figure S12) that allow a limited space for rearrangements. Overall, our data revealed that tail dihedral angle φ2 plays a key role in Chol’s dynamics. Through combination of new SSNMR experiments on highly enriched U-13C-Chol and all-atom MD simulations in combination with QM calculations, it was possible to resolve coupled dynamics of Chol in lipid bilayers. The development of a fully scalar 3D pulse sequence allowed for precise and consistent collection of OP at each site throughout the Chol molecule. The OP extracted from the MD simulations matched the experimental results. The direct connection of experimental and simulations results allowed us to determine the actual tail conformations present in the experimental sample, and multiple lines of analysis revealed coupled segmental dynamics. Chol tails impact motions of the whole molecules. We are intrigued by the future opportunities that this unique combination of methodologies has opened to study Chol influence on functional dynamics of proteins and small molecule drug targets.

        "Segmental Dynamics of Membranous Cholesterol are Coupled",
        "Lisa A. Della Ripa, Joseph M. Courtney, Samantha M. Phinney, Collin G. Borcik, Martin D. Burke,* Chad M. Rienstra,* and Taras V. Pogorelov*Cite This: J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 15043-15048 Read OnlineABSTRACT: Cholesterol promotes the structural integrity of the fluid cell membrane and interacts dynamically with many membrane proteins to regulate function. Understanding site-resolved cholesterol structural dynamics is thus important. This long-standing challenge has thus far been addressed, in part, by selective isotopic labeling approaches. Here we present a new 3D solid-state NMR (SSNMR) experiment utilizing scalar 13C-13C polarization transfer and recoupling of the 1H-13C interactions in order to determine average dipolar couplings for all 1H-13C vectors in uniformly 13C-enriched cholesterol. The experimentally determined order parameters (OP) agree exceptionally well with molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories and reveal coupling among several conformational degrees of freedom in cholesterol molecules. Quantum chemistry shielding calculations further support this conclusion and specifically demonstrate that ring tilt and rotation are coupled to changes in tail conformation and that these coupled segmental dynamics dictate the orientation of cholesterol. These findings advance our understanding of physiologically relevant dynamics of cholesterol, and the methods that revealed them have broader potential to characterize how structural dynamics of other small molecules impact their biological functions.",
        "structural dynamics play a critical role in proteinfunction,1-3phenomena reveal new opportunities for next generation rational drug design.4,5 Similar dynamics likely also play a role in the functions of many biologically active small molecules.6 But this area has been relatively underdeveloped, and tools for interrogating small molecule dynamics in biologically relevant settings are lacking. These limitations are reflected in the longstanding challenge of understanding the dynamics of cholesterol (Chol) (Figure 1E), one of the most important small molecules in mammalian physiology.",
        "Chol is also very important in human medicine. High levels increase the risk of heart disease, and cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors can mitigate these risks.7-9 Dose-limiting renal toxicity of the clinically vital antifungal drug amphotericin B (AmB) requires cholesterol binding,10,11,14 and AmB analogs with greater selectivity for binding ergosterol relative to Chol have improved therapeutic indices in preclinical studies.12,13 Chol also plays an important role in the capacity of AmB ion channels to serve as molecular prosthetics for missing or dysfunctional CFTR anion channels. Chol also plays a key role in viral infectivity; for example, HIV fusion peptides preferentially target Chol-rich membrane regions.14 Chol interactions with proteins such as α-synuclein15 and β-amyloid16 are postulated to be critical to regulation of protein aggregation in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.16,17Chol dynamics in living systems have been the subject of intense study, but insights have been slow to emerge. Sterol lateral mobility has been studied by fluorescence microscopy, but these studies are limited by the potential artifactual effects of the chemical modifications. Experiments combining site-specific deuterium (2H) labeling with SSNMR spectroscopy can measure the magnitude and time scale of molecular motions in phospholipid bilayers. These properties are reported in OP18-21 and quadrupolar relaxation rates,22 respectively, and are used to quantify Chol modulation of membrane fluidity as a function of composition and temper-ature.23 A 2H SSNMR spectroscopy-based study demonstrated that the acyclic aliphatic tail, but not the fused tetracyclic core, of Chol contributes to membrane condensation.24 Intermo-lecular 13C-19F REDOR distances identified the Chol-binding motifs in M2 underlying the mechanism of membrane scission in budding virus cells.25 These studies are currently limited in both efficiency and resolution due to their dependence on site-specific labeling.",
        "A roadmap for addressing these limitations has been laid in recent studies of the structures and dynamics of membrane and fibrous proteins, leveraging combined uniform isotopic enrich-ment, high magnetic fields, and state-of-the-art SSNMR methods.26-33 These powerful strategies have been proven useful for more illuminating functionally relevant interactions of Chol with membrane proteins.34-36 Here we employed a combination of uniformly labeled Chol (U-13C-Chol), new 3D SSNMR experiments that utilize scalar 13C-13C polarization transfer and recoupling of the 1H-13C interactions to determine average dipolar couplings for all 1H-13C vectors, and multilevel theory including all-atom MD simulations and QM calculations to illuminate the structure and dynamics of Chol in membrane with heightened resolution. We reveal that© 2023 American Chemical Societyhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c01775 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 15043-15048the segmental dynamics of Chol in palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membranes are coupled, and such coupling dictates the orientation.",
        "We first attempted to measure the 1H-13C dipolar couplings using a fully dipolar 3D R-symmetry37,38 experiment (Figure 1A), which recouples heteronuclear but decouples homonu-clear couplings. The SSNMR experiments place the chemical shifts of the 13C-13C correlation into the ω1-ω3 dimensions and the C-H dipolar coupling in the ω2 dimension and correspond to the C-H dipolar coupling of the 13C site along the ω1 axis. We used 1H-13C cross-polarization (CP) and 13C-13C SPCn mixing39 to achieve signal enhancement and dipolar mixing, respectively. The resulting CP-SPCn-RNnv 3D spectrum exhibited some surprising spectral features. First, several one-bond correlations are missing. For example, the 2D SPCn spectrum in Figure 1B lacks correlations between C11-C9 and C8-C9. Second, several peaks are asymmetric across the diagonal, such as C25-C26 and C9-C10. Third, for several sites the two-bond correlations are stronger than one-bond correlations. For example, it is particularly striking in Figure 1B how weak the C2-C3 and C4-C3 correlations are compared to other one-bond correlations. Having precisely assessed the site-specific 13C-labeling percentages previously,40 we focus our attention on the spectroscopic origins of these surprising results.",
        "A major advantage of 3D SSNMR is that each data set contains an abundance of internal controls to confirm that the experiment and sample remain stable throughout data collection. For Chol, multiple peaks report on the same heteronuclear dipolar coupling; e.g, the C9-C9, C8-C9, C10-C9, and C11-C9 (ω1-ω3) cross-and autocorrelation peaks all report on (multiple) 1H-13C dipolar couplings to the C9 site, and the (in)consistency of the obtained OP (in)validates the resulting interpretation. The fully dipolar experiment yielded systematic differences in the dipolar line shape data (Figure 1C) and the fitted OP (Figure 1D). Extreme examples of this�where the dipolar vectors lie near the magic angle relative to the motional axis, such as C11-C9 and C8-C9�show nearly complete averaging of the couplings and therefore peaks with marginal signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios. We hypothesized that the differences among these sites, both in the data quality and resulting fits, arose due to the orientational dependence of the 1H-13C and 13C-13C dipolar couplings responsible for transferring polarization to each 13C site in ω1-ω3 respectively. If correct, such effects can be a powerful way to probe the molecular orientation. To test this hypothesis, we interrogated if these effects on the hetero-nuclear dipolar coupling measurements would be negated if we implemented a direct polarization (DP) COSY R-symmetry or fully scalar (through-bond) scheme. We developed a version of the pulse sequence comprising 13C DP followed by polar-ization transfer using the CTUC-COSY mixing scheme,41 followed by the same type of R-symmetry heteronuclear recoupling (Figure 2A).42 The spectrum derived from this DP-COSY-RNnv sequence has sensitivity higher than that of the CP-SPCn-RNnv dipolar version and reports only on the one-bond correlations under the conditions employed here. Supporting our hypothesis, the DP-COSY-RNnv experiment yielded consistent OP derived from all correlations (Figure 2C, 2D), including those of C9 where the C8-C9 and C11-C9 peaks were absent from the fully dipolar spectrum. Multiple OP determinations from the same spectrum increased the robustness and precision of these measurements, and we thus obtained a highly confident experimental OP for the entire Chol molecule.",
        "The OP obtained from MD simulations (Figure 3A) of Chol in a POPC membrane (Figure 3B) agreed with the experimental data (Figures 3C, S3), enabling interrogation ofthe results of the MD. We expand upon the agreement of SSNMR to MD OP in the supplementary text.",
        "In addition to the extraction of OP which report on the rotational motion of a bond vector, temporal and spatial resolution of all-atom MD simulations enabled reporting on the dynamic chemical environment of membranous Chol.21,24 Our MD simulations revealed the preferred conformations sampled by the Chol tails (Figure 4). We define the five tail dihedral angles φ1-φ5 (Figures 4A, S5), and as expected, φ1 mostly samples the gauche conformation (Figure 4A), to minimize the steric clash that occurs between the C21 and C18 methyl groups. On the other hand, the φ5 is equally sampling the gauche and trans conformations, in agreement with the single peak for C26 and C27 in the NMR spectrum. The other dihedral angles primarily adopt trans conformations. These findings agree with previous computational studies,21,24 and our calculated CS distributions agree with SSNMR-measured shifts (Figures S4, S6, S7).",
        "We examined the CS agreement using the RMSD between the SSNMR and MD-based QM by gradually increasing the xtxxx population of φ1-φ5 angles from 0% to 100%, in the background of the xgxxx population, where x is either gauche or trans (Figure 4B). The experimental and calculated CS as a function of φ2 conformation revealed that, for the best agreement, ∼70% of the Chol tails have to be in a trans φ2 dihedral conformation in POPC membranes in the liquid phase. Remarkably, our approach provided insight into the preferred conformations of the Chol tails in the SSNMR sample. By this metric, our MD simulations agree well with the experimental data, as a larger portion of the Chols (61%) had a trans φ2 conformation which is within the accuracy of this study (Figure 4B). We suggest that the approach outlined here in principle can be used for future improvements in force fields.",
        "We then used the MD of tail dihedral angles and Chol tilt and rotation to gain insights into the Chol dynamics within the membrane. Using cross-correlation analysis of tail dihedral angles and molecular motions (see Table S1) we revealed coupled dynamics of membranous Chol. Specifically, there aresignificant correlations between φ2 and both the tilt angle and axial rotation of Chol as well as anticorrelation between the latter (Figures 4C, S8-S9). Our approach also shows that, as expected from their geometry, the dynamics of the highly mobile φ4 and φ5 are positively correlated, and importantly, the strength of their coupling, 0.33 (Figure 4E), can serve as a basis for comparison for other values. The Chol dynamics and that of its tail are correlated, as φ2 influences the rotation and tilt of the whole molecule. Appropriately, the MD lifetimes of these three processes are similar (Figure S11). Intriguingly, a previous computational study45 suggested the importance of the C21 methyl group, the node between φ1 and φ2, in maintaining optimal Chol tilt. Further analysis of the tail dihedral angles using a Markov model revealed that a direct gauche to trans transition of φ2 was rarely observed in simulations and that a plausible pathway needs to involve changes in dihedral angles downstream of φ2�in a “crankshaft manner” (Figure S11, Table S2). The direct transition from gauche to trans for φ2 may require a large motion of the tail while in close proximity to lipid tails as well as neighboring Chol46 molecules. In fact, in agreement with a recent study,47 our MD simulations also revealed formation of Chol oligomers (Figure S12) that allow a limited space for rearrangements. Overall, our data revealed that tail dihedral angle φ2 plays a key role in Chol’s dynamics.",
        "Through combination of new SSNMR experiments on highly enriched U-13C-Chol and all-atom MD simulations in combination with QM calculations, it was possible to resolve coupled dynamics of Chol in lipid bilayers. The development of a fully scalar 3D pulse sequence allowed for precise and consistent collection of OP at each site throughout the Chol molecule. The OP extracted from the MD simulations matched the experimental results. The direct connection of experimental and simulations results allowed us to determine the actual tail conformations present in the experimental sample, and multiple lines of analysis revealed coupled segmental dynamics. Chol tails impact motions of the whole molecules. We are intrigued by the future opportunities that this unique combination of methodologies has opened to study Chol influence on functional dynamics of proteins and small molecule drug targets.",
