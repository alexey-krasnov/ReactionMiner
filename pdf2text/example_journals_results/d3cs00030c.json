Unrau * The field of fluorogenic RNA aptamers is a burgeoning research area that aims to address the lack of naturally fluorescent RNA molecules for RNA detection and imaging. These small RNA tags bind to their fluorogenic ligands resulting in significant fluorescent enhancement, leading to a molar brightness comparable to or exceeding that of fluorescent proteins. In the past decade, multiple light-up RNA aptamer systems have been isolated that bind to a broad range of ligands involving several distinct mechanisms of fluorogenicity. This review discusses the selection methods used to isolate fluorogenic RNA aptamers. More than seventy fluorogenic aptamer:ligand pairs are evaluated using objective parameters (e.g., molar brightness, binding affinity, fluorophore exchange capabilities and other details). General guidelines for choosing fluorescent RNA tools, with an emphasis on single-molecule detection and multi-colour imaging applications are provided. Lastly the importance of global standards for evaluating fluorogenic RNA aptamer systems is discussed. 1. Introduction The fluorescent imaging of biomolecules together with a broad range of fluorescence detection methodologies has paved the way for powerful discoveries in the biological sciences. Directly visualizing biological processes with light is a minimally invasive method that provides insight into the complex inner workings of life. The central importance of RNA in cellular processes and disease has resulted in a burgeoning field of fluorescent light-up RNA aptamer tools (FLAPs, also referred to as fluorogenic RNA aptamers). These RNA imaging tools are now approaching and, in some cases, exceeding the capabilities of protein-based fluor-escent imaging. As a result, they show great promise to truly integrate proteomic and transcriptomic studies. Historically, tremendous efforts have been made to develop the naturally occurring fluorescent proteins (FP) into valuable fluorescent tagging tools. First described in 1994, the study and application of green FP (GFP)1–3 as a genetically encodable FP tag, paved the way for the engineering of a broad colour palette of FPs that span the visible light spectrum.3 In addition to studying gene expression and cellular protein localization,2,4 biotechnological developments have resulted in a range of Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.

Applications range from genetically encoded protein biosensors for voltage,5 calcium,6 and potassium7 to sensors able to measure NADPH,8 citrate9 and L-lactate10 concentrations. However, these fluorescence-based protein biotechnologies preclude the ability to study RNA-dependent processes easily. This is particularly critical as transcription, RNA maturation, RNA regulation, and transla-tional processes all depend on RNA, with many more RNAs being transcribed than being translated.11 While FPs have enabled spatial and dynamic studies of the proteome and cellular state, there is yet to be discovered an intrinsically fluorescent biological RNA counterpart to study the transcrip-tome and RNA-dependent processes in vitro and in vivo. While general nucleic acid and RNA-selective fluorogenic stains have been reported,12–15 these fluorophores lack the specificity required to image individual RNA species within a cell. Currently, there are multiple distinct strategies for the fluorescent labelling of specific RNA species in vitro and in vivo. Using chemical modifications, fluorophores are typically covalently attached to nucleic acid, either internally or at the 50or 30 end.16 These exogenous nucleic acid probes are tradi-tionally used in methods such as molecular beacons17 and smFISH,18 which allows for in vitro detection and fixed cell imaging respectively. The disadvantages of these tools are that they are neither genetically encodable nor cell permeable. In contrast to these in vitro methods, the current gold standard for in vivo RNA imaging is the MS2-MCP system4,19 and the closely related systems (e.g., PP7-PCP,20 U1A-U1Ap21 and boxB-N peptide22). Tagging an RNA of interest (ROI) with a specific MS2 sequence able to bind tightly to the MS2 coat protein (MCP), allows a FP to be recruited specifically to an ROI by fusing the FP to MCP (FP-MCP).4,19 However, this FP-reliant method can suffer from high background fluorescence due to unbalanced RNA and protein expression levels. As a result, the field of fluorogenic RNA aptamers has emerged in order to develop RNA counterparts to FPs to address these disadvantages. In these light-up RNA aptamer systems, specific RNA sequences termed RNA aptamers, bind and thus dramatically enhance the fluorescence of a fluorogenic ligand that is exogen-ous to the biological system (Fig. 1A). As a result, the efficiency of these two component systems is greatly dependent on the detailed characteristics of both the RNA aptamer and its cognate fluorogenic ligand. Ideally the pair must achieve a high molar fluorescent brightness (MNone1 cmNone1), while doing so with high specificity to enable multi-colour imaging. To date, light-up RNA aptamer systems exploit three general mechanisms of fluoro-genicity: Nonetwisted Noneintramolecular Nonecharge Nonetransfer (TICT), 23,24 Nonecontact Nonequenching (CQ), 25 and NonesNonepirolactonization (SP) 26 leading to a high diversity of fluorescence and binding properties, with a corresponding range of biological compatibilities. This review highlights more than seventy fluorogenic aptamer:ligand pairs, the properties of which are collated in Table 1. TICT-based fluorogenic ligands are extremely sensitive to their local chemical environment and aptamers that control fluorophore conformation have resulted in very bright fluoro-genic systems that are thousands of times brighter than their unbound fluorophore (Fig. 1B). TICT-fluorophores consist of an electron donor (ED) and an electron acceptor moiety (EA) that are linked by a twisted conjugated system that allows for intra-molecular rotation (e.g., methine bridge, overlapping methine or single bond).

Relaxa-tion of this excited TICT state to the ground state then occurs by two main competing processes: fluorescence emission and non-radiative relaxation to the immediate environment.23,24 Ideally, the aptamer bound complex maximizes the process of fluores-cence emission while the unbound state maximizes the yield of nonradiative decay. CQ-based fluorogenic systems covalently link a fluorescent molecule to a high-efficiency short-range quencher. The quencher absorbs energy from the fluorescent fluorophore effectively quenching its fluorescence via nonradiative decay.25 RNA aptamers able to bind either the fluorophore or the quencher physically separate the quencher from the fluoro-phore, allowing it to regain most of its intrinsic fluorescence due to separation of the two moieties (Fig. 1C). SP-based fluorogenic ligands are xanthene-based dyes with fluorescein or rhodamine scaffolds. Here, an intramolecular rearrangement occurs where an equilibrium exists between the open fluorescent quinoid form and the closed non-fluorescent lactone form (Fig. 1D). Based on the polarity of the surrounding environment, this intramolecular equilibrium can shift to favour either the closed or open form.26 Therefore, a change in local environment to favour the open fluorescent form can be achieved upon binding to an RNA aptamer. This review will cover the current selection methods used to identify fluorogenic RNA aptamers, discuss essential photo-physical and biocompatible properties for choosing the optimal tagging system, describe the progression from the early light-up RNA aptamer systems to the current repertoire that is expanding into multi-colour imaging, evaluate their photophysical proper-ties, discuss how specific aptamer qualities meet the require-ments of advanced microscopy applications, and describe their imaging applications to date. General guidelines will be provided for choosing the optimal system from this fluorescent RNA toolbox for specific applications. We end this review with future outlooks that aim to standardize the evaluation of light-up RNA aptamer systems as well as provide perspective for the develop-ment of the next generation of RNA imaging systems. 2. Light-up RNA aptamer selection methods Light-up RNA aptamer systems have been identified through one, or a combination of, in vitro and in vivo methods. Once a target fluorogenic ligand (Fig. 1) has been identified, RNA aptamers against this ligand can be isolated using high diversity (initial RNA populations ranging from 1014–1016 distinct sequences) in vitro selection to screen for aptamers that either have high binding affinity (low KD and low ligand off-rates) or that can rapidly exchange their fluorogenic ligand. Lower diver-sity libraries of aptamers (B106) resulting from such initial screens can then be fed into more novel selection methods that focus on fluorescence-based screening such as microfluidic droplet-based screening or Nonefluorescence-Noneactivated Nonecell Nonesorting (FACS)-based in vivo selection. 2.1 In vitro selection of fluorogenic ligand aptamers In vitro selection (also referred to as Nonesystematic Noneevolution of Noneligands by NoneeNonexponential enrichment or SELEX) is an iterative method used to exponentially enrich for functional nucleic acid subpopulations, in this case RNA, from a high diversity pool population.27–30 Initial RNA pools are typically generated by in vitro transcription of a PCR template pool consisting of an uninterrupted randomized sequence element. Typically, each template has a defined 50 and 30 sequence region to allow for reverse transcription, PCR amplifica-tion, and subsequent in vitro transcription in order to regenerate the pool after each round of selection (Fig. 2A). Traditionally, the target ligand is derivatized with a linker to allow for attachment onto a solid phase. RNA pools can then be incubated with the target ligand and washing steps with selective conditions are performed in order to isolate for high affinity binders.29,30 Binding has typically been performed at neutral pH and in high potassium to simulate intracellular conditions. In a competitive in vitro selection, the RNA pool is first pre-incubated with competitors before incubation with the immo-bilized target ligand to improve target specificity (Fig. 2A). Competitors can include closely related molecules or orthogo-nal ligands intended for generation of multiplex orthogonal light-up RNA systems. Inappropriate binders with slow compe-titor off-rates are unable to rebind to the immobilized target ligand, allowing them to be eliminated by stringent washing steps. To discard fast off-rate aptamers, the free target ligand can also be added to these washes so as to prevent rebinding to immobile support. Target ligand binding aptamers are then recovered from the support and regenerated by RT-PCR fol-lowed by in vitro transcription to undergo another round of selection. After selection, the enriched RNA pools are evaluated based on their phenotypic and genotypic properties. At this step, the aptamer sequence can be truncated31 to isolate the optimal minimal binding motif which can often further improve aptamer performance.32,33 Individual aptamers from the enriched pool are then characterized, by measuring spectral properties, fluorescence enhancement (FE), and binding affinity (dissociation constant, KD). Structural analysis for the most promising candidate(s) can then be used to identify ligand binding modes and serve to initiate the rational design of improved variants.33 How the aptamers are recovered from the immobile support plays a key role in the final fluorophore-aptamer binding mode. There are broadly two distinct strategies of elution: denaturing or competitive binding, both having distinct advantages and disadvantages. Denaturing the RNA aptamers to release from the beads has resulted in very high affinity binding interactions (sub-nanomolar)34,35 with very low off-rates for the Mango series of aptamers (Table 1, No. 25–38).34,36 A disadvantage of this approach is that the aptamers can evolve specificity to the linker used to immobilize the ligand to the solid support. Alternatively, addition of free ligand can be used to recover aptamers as was originally performed with the Spinach series of aptamers (Table 1, No. 8–11).32,37,38 This strategy has resulted in micromolar affinity ligand binders with fast exchange rates Chem Soc Rev Review Article Pu bl is he d on  06 Ju ne  202 3.

Most critically, selection for binding affinity does not select for the fluorescence brightness of the ligand-bound RNA species. Therefore, aptamers within the pool must be screened individu-ally for fluorescence after the selection. This procedure can be performed in a high-throughput fashion by screening the output population of an affinity-based selection using fluorescence-activated microfluidics droplet-based screening32,36,40 (Fig. 2B) or FACS-based in vivo cell-based selection41 (Fig. 2C). 2.2 Microfluidics droplet-based screening and FACS-based in vivo selection The high-throughput screening of several millions of molecular variants was revolutionized by microfluidic droplet-based selec-tion protocols originally developed by Tawfik and Griffith.42 The key advantage of this methodology being that genotype is linked to phenotype, as result of both being within the same microscopic droplet. Briefly, and as reviewed in greater depth elsewhere,43 the primary goal is to ensure that a single DNA genome is formed within a small droplet that also contains the reagents required for in vitro transcription and fluorogenic imaging. As droplets can be formed and fused with consider-able precision, the concentration of fluorogenic ligands is precisely known in each droplet. If transcription conditions are also chosen where there is an excess of RNA transcript over the ligand concentration, then the brightest droplets correspond to the aptamers with the highest FE (Fig. 2B). For example, by sorting millions of droplets using a fluorescence droplet sorter, a 4-fold increase in complex brightness for MIII: TO1-B was found relative to that possible using low-throughput manual screening methods when identifying the original MI variant.36 To help ensure the isolation of biologically compa-tible fluorogenic aptamers, the Jaffrey laboratory developed the Broccoli:DFHBI-1T system (Table 1, No. 12) using FACS-based directed evolution.41 A plasmid library containing the low diversity pool and co-expressing the far-red FP (eqFP670) was used as a control for plasmid copy number, which was then transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) (Fig. 2C). Gating on the FP and the DFHBI-1T signal resulted in an isolate that was subsequently improved by directed FACS-based evolution to produce RNA Broccoli.

This two-step approach of first selecting high affinity binders, followed by the selection for high brightness complexes has resulted in bright fluorogenic aptamer systems.34,36 3. Guidelines for selecting an RNA light-up aptamer system There are multiple factors one must consider when choosing a light-up RNA aptamer system for a specific imaging application. The factors that pertain to both the aptamer and fluorophore components individually and together in complex are highlighted here. These include: the ratio of bound to unbound fluorogenic ligand fluorescence intensity, which is defined as the fluorescent enhancement (FE), aptamer binding affinity (indicated by the dissociation constant, KD), and bound molar fluorescence bright-ness of the fluorogenic ligand (Table 1). In addition to this, we emphasize specific properties that are required for different applications including: single-molecule imaging, super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, two-colour imaging, in vitro diag-nostic detection, and in vitro pull-down assays. 3.1 Photophysical properties A diverse set of light-up RNA aptamer systems have been identified using a wide variety of fluorogenic ligands and isolated using a range of aptamer selection methods. Photo-physical properties of each system are summarized in Table 1. The molar brightness (defined as the product of extinction coefficient multiplied by the quantum yield) of each aptamer-fluorophore complex is dependent on inherent characteristics of both the aptamer and fluorogenic ligand. A high molar fluores-cent brightness is preferable. At this time many fluorogenic aptamer systems are brighter than EGFP which has a brightness of 34 000 MNone1 cmNone1 (ref. 44). Of these two determinant factors, the quantum yield is expected to change significantly more than the extinction coefficient upon formation of the bound ligand state. In addition to fluorophore binding, quantum yield is strongly correlated with the exact binding poise, which defines the local environment and solvent accessibility of the fluorogenic ligand within the aptamer binding pocket. This is illustrated by compar-ing the diverse core motifs within the RNA Mango series that all serve to rigidify its target ligand TO1-B (Fig. 3A). Comparing the crystal structures of Mango (M) I, II, and III.1 variants (Table 1, No. 25, 28 and 33), there is a progression in the bound ligand solvent accessibility as well as increasing co-planarity between the two heterocycles. In MI (Table 1, No. 25), one side of the fluorophore is solvent accessible with a B451 twist between the heterocycles resulting in a quantum yield of 0.14 (ref. 34 and 65). In MII (Table 1, No. 28), one side of the fluorophore is solvent accessible but the heterocycles are now coplanar resulting in a slightly improved quantum yield of 0.21 (ref. 66). Lastly in the MIII.1 variant (Table 1, No. 33), the fluorophore is both solvent inaccessible and lies flat leading to a much more improved quantum yield of 0.66 (ref. 33). As these examples include the same fluorophore bound by three distinct aptamers, this shows the pivotal role of binding mode in order to achieve a high quantum yield, that together with the extinction coefficient of the bound fluorophore generates a high molar brightness of the bound state. 3.2 Binding affinity (KD), fluorescence enhancement (FE), and fluorescence efficiency (E) Binding affinity (KD). Published RNA light-up aptamers have KD values that range from sub-nanomolar (nM) to sub-millimolar (mM) concentrations (Table 1, ‘‘KD’’ column). KD depends on many variables, pertaining to the architecture of the aptamer binding pocket, that affects the propensity of the fluorogenic ligand to stack and make hydrogen bonds with the nucleic acid bases of its cognate aptamer. KD can be a limiting parameter in applications where the ROI and the fluorogenic ligand are present at low concentrations either in vivo or in vitro. Cell membrane permeability of the fluorogenic ligand can limit the amount of ligand available to bind to the aptamer (see Section 3.5: Biological compatibility for details). As KD ¼ ½Free ligandNoneeq None ½RNA aptamerNoneeq ½RNA aptamer:ligandNoneeq ; saturating aptamer binding will only occur when the fluorogenic ligand concentration is several multiples of the KD, potentially limiting the sensitivity of RNA detection if such concentrations are not guaranteed. A majority of published fluorogenic RNA aptamers contain potassium-dependent G-quadruplex (G4) motifs as the core bind-ing motif83 (Table 1, in ‘‘Properties’’ column indicated by ‘G’). G4s are formed by the stacking of two or more G-tetrads that are in turn formed from four guanine bases, that are hydrogen bonded to each other by a 4-fold cyclic permutation of their Hoogsteen and Watson Crick edges.84 With their extensive hydrogen bonding and p–p stacking interactions, these flat motifs form very thermodynamically stable structures upon which fluorogenic ligands can stack. Aside from the recurring theme of G4s in the core aptamer motif, structures immediately peripheral to the binding G4 core typically enhance fluorogenic ligand binding affinity. This trend is reflected in Mango series of aptamers where mutations in such regions were able to disrupt or improve secondary structures resulting in corres-ponding changes in KD. 33,66 Similarly, RNA Spinach serves to rigidify a range of fluorogenic ligands within its core binding motif by sandwiching ligands between a planar G-tetrad and a base triple.85 This theme is not specific to RNA Spinach or Mango aptamers and many fluorogenic aptamers induce fluorescence by stabilizing fluorophores using large nucleic acid planar surfaces such as base quadruples or base-triple motifs within their binding cores33,50,53,65,66,71,72,86 (Fig. 4). Fluorescence enhancement (FE). Fluorogenicity is quantified by FE, which is the fold change of the fluorescent molar brightness of the bound ligand state divided by the brightness of the unbound ligand state (FE = Fbound/Funbound). Conse-quently, both the high brightness of a bound complex and the dim background fluorescence of an unbound ligand con-tribute to a higher FE.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023light-up RNA aptamer systems exploit TICT-based fluorogenic mechanisms as aptamer binding cores can be readily selected to stabilize bright planar fluorophore conformations by secondary motifs. Of the current published light-up RNA aptamer systems, the highest FE is of the Pepper:HBC497 system (Table 1, No. 46) achieving a 17 000-fold FE (ref. 35), demonstrating the high fluorogenic potential of the TICT-based fluorophores. In contrast, the FE potential of contact quenching (CQ)-based fluorogenic ligands is highly dependent on the details of the fluorophore ligand design. The design must take into consideration the fluorescent moiety, which should have a high molar brightness in the absence of the quencher, and an optimal linker geometry between the fluorophore and quencher to ensure maximal fluorescence quenching of the ligand in unbound state. These aptamer systems tend to have lower FE compared to TICT-based fluorogenic ligands as a result (Table 1). Light-up RNA aptamer systems using CQ-based fluorogenic ligands have been identified where the aptamer binds to either the fluorophore or quencher moiety (see Section 5.2: New aptamer systems with multi-colour ligands for details). Lastly, light-up RNA aptamer systems that utilize spirolacto-nization (SP)-based fluorogenic ligands have been identified. In these systems, fluorogenicity is dependent on the fluorophores intramolecular equilibrium between the ‘‘On’’ and ‘‘Off’’ fluor-escent state which in turn is reliant on the environment.26 The FE of systems with SP-based fluorogenic ligands is typically quite low (Table 1). Binding to the aptamer provides a local environment which stabilizes the ‘‘On’’ state, by mechanisms that have yet to be fully characterized.

The KD and FE together define the fluorescent efficiency (E = FE/KD, nM None1), which describes the contrast between the aptamer bound fluorogenic ligand and the background fluorescence from unbound fluorophore in the presence of minimal fluorophore or aptamer concentrations34 (Fig. 3B). Unless well localized, very low concentrations of RNA per imaged voxel are typically expected.87 Larger values of E indicate that an aptamer:ligand pair is likely to have a higher signal-to-background noise ratio, especially when fluorophore concentrations are only several times higher than KD to ensure saturation of binding to the aptamer tag. 3.3 Determining the thermal stability of fluorogenic RNA aptamers Comparatively, few studies to date have completely decon-volved the effect of temperature on fluorogenic aptamer systems.39 Analysis is complicated by the fact that both the KD and the molar brightness of the bound complex, which is determined by the local environment of the binding core, are temperature dependent. UV (absorbance at 260 nm) and fluorescence melting curves of the Spinach and Mango apta-mers reveal the complexity of such systems.39 When directly comparing the two types of melting curves, the Tm of UV curves is directly related to RNA structure and its melting, but may not be directly correlated to fluorophore binding. Previously published Tm values typically range from 70–80 1C, which is consistent with the high thermal stability of G4 structures.88 These UV-derived Tm values tend to be higher than the melting points derived from fluorescence-based melting curves. The TF value is defined as the temperature at which half maximal fluorescence of the aptamer:ligand complex has been achieved.32,38 Since binding poise may change with tempera-ture, the TF does not directly measure complex melting. There-fore, the data collection method should be considered when comparing the thermal stabilities of different aptamers using Tm versus TF values. 3.4 Photostability, photobleaching, and fluorescent regeneration Photostability is an attractive feature for all imaging applications, allowing for intense illumination conditions, stable signals, and long imaging times. In contrast to FPs, where photobleaching of its internal fluorophore can result in the permanent loss of fluorescence, light-up RNA aptamer systems hold the potential to spontaneously regenerate fluorescence upon photobleaching due to the use of an extrinsic fluorophore, which can be exchanged upon photobleaching.56,67,89,90 Such fluorescent regeneration can considerably extend the photon budget of an fluorogenic aptamer system in ways not possible for conventional FPs or covalently attached fluorophores. Currently, photobleaching mechanisms and their resulting products are not yet fully understood but photobleaching processes can include photoisomerization,56 oxidation,91 or entry into triplet excited states.92 In one potential pathway, photobleaching can result in the covalent crosslinking of the fluorophore to the aptamer and/or photodamage of the binding pocket resulting in either permanent occupation of the binding pocket or inhibition of binding with a consequent loss of fluorescence. Such effects have unfortunately proven to occur in protein systems.93 More ideally, photobleaching of a fluoro-phore within the binding pocket of the aptamer can result in either a change in the fluorophore conformation or its 4080 | Chem.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023photoinduced degradation, either of which can promote dis-sociation of the photobleached products from the aptamer binding pocket (Fig. 5A). Due to this dependence on fluoro-phore exchange, fluorescent regeneration speed is directly related to the binding kinetics of the unaltered and photo-bleached fluorogenic ligands. Each light-up RNA aptamer system can be considered to be at equilibrium with its unbound and bound states. Upon exposure to light, fluorescent blinking rates will be dictated by an intrinsic on-rate k 0 On None None and off-rate k 0 Off None None for their target ligand (Fig. 5B). In the event of photobleaching, the conforma-tion and/or structure of the target ligand is now altered. As a result, off-rate for the photobleached product k 00 Off None None can be increased and the on-rate k 00 On None None decreased. This holds the potential for the target ligand with a superior KD to competi-tively displace its photobleached counterpart allowing for fluorophore exchange (Fig. 5C). Slow exchange aptamers such as MII (dissociation in hours), intermediate exchange aptamers such as Broccoli and Pepper (dissociation within minutes to hours) and rapid exchange aptamers such as RhoBAST (dissociation on a second timescale) have demonstrated this interesting photoexchange property,35,56,67,77,89 which has many ramifications for continuous and super-resolution imaging dis-cussed later. The Mango systems, with uniquely slow dissocia-tion rates, also enable the downstream pulldown of fluorescent tagged RNA allowing for further characterizations.68,94,95 3.5 Biological compatibility for in vivo use When using light-up RNA aptamer systems in vivo, one must consider the biological compatibility of the fluorogenic ligand and RNA aptamer as individual components and together as a system (Fig. 6A) for both live-and fixed-cell imaging. First and foremost, the fluorophore must ideally be able to passively diffuse across the cellular membrane into the cell and should not introduce toxicity. Membrane permeability,96 especially for polar or charged ligands with a high molecular weight, as well as cell viability97 should therefore always be tested. Unfortunately, these parameters have not been measured directly for the ligands of fluorogenic RNA aptamers. If diffusion into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cell is possible, it can likely also enter the nucleus via nuclear pores.79 Rigidification of TICT type ligands by bacterial cell walls has been observed during bacterial imaging and background fluorescence can be higher than observed in eukaryotic tissue culture.34,68 In either cell type, entry into the cytoplasm does not guarantee that the fluorophore will form a complex with its RNA aptamer partner. Since the fluorophore is a foreign small molecule, inappropriate compart-mentalization (such as into the lysosome) can occur, sequestering it away from cellular compartments containing RNA. Fluoro-phores with handles of biological origins, such as cobalamin,76 may also lead to inappropriate binding leading to non-specific background fluorescence although biotin modifications to date do not appear to present an issue.67 When using genetically encoded aptamers to tag an ROI, the location of the tag insertion site and its specific sequence may alter the RNAs function and/or lifetime (Fig. 6A). Since aptamer sequences are biologically foreign, they must not trigger pre-mature degradation of the tagged ROI nor lead to cell death by perturbing the native function of the RNA. As previously men-tioned, G4s are motifs commonly found within RNA aptamer binding cores (Table 1). The presence of G4s in fluorogenic aptamer tags could also impede RNA functions, such as gene expression and translation.84 Cellular helicases that unwind G4 motifs are known in eukaryotes98 and their effect on the cellular fluorescence of G4-based systems is currently not well This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 | 4081understood. Despite these caveats, arrays of fluorogenic apta-mers have been successfully inserted into the 30 UTR of mRNAs without perturbing mRNA localization (e.g., dBroccoli and Mango arrays).56,67 RNA and/or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes often require RNA stem-loops to reverse the orientation of an RNA strand within a functional complex. The GNRA tetraloop being a very common way to achieve this in biology. Replacing tetraloops with fluorogenic aptamers that contain a GNRA-like sub-motif is therefore a powerful way to insert a fluoro-genic tag into a functional RNA, that would otherwise be difficult to modify. Both RNA MI and MII for example, contain a GAA^A stem-loop motif-like adapter that isolates their G4-containing ligand binding cores from an external RNA sequence. It has proven possible to tag the essential U1 spliceosomal RNP complex at an isosteric GNRA tetraloop position without loss of biological function94 (Fig. 6B). It appears likely that many other biological RNAs and RNP complex will be able to be fluorogenically tagged without impeding biological function. However, the possible artifacts resulting from tagging should be carefully evaluated. For exam-ple, the insertion of MS2 hairpins may impede the proper degradation of mRNA and result in aberrant mRNA metabolism due to the tight binding of MS2-MCP.99,100 4. ‘‘First generation’’ light-up RNA aptamers RNA-based in vitro selection has led to the rapid isolation of the fluorogenic RNA aptamer:ligand systems that are now being tested in a broad range of in vivo and in vitro contexts. Initial selections focused on optimization of basic photophysical properties such as KD, FE, and brightness, allowing for single-colour imaging and detection. These selections identified the importance of biological compatibility and have produced systems that exhibit fluorophore recycling which enable con-tinuous live and fixed cell imaging of RNA. This section focuses on the characterization and utilization of the best characterized fluorogenic RNA aptamer systems to date, before moving onto recently developed second-generation systems, that continue to expand the RNA imaging toolbox. As described previously, the E metric is plotted against wavelength in Fig. 3B in order to evaluate the performance of light-up RNA systems. 4.1 Early fluorogenic aptamers The first fluorogenic RNA aptamers, MG aptamer and SRB aptamers were isolated by Babendure et al. in 2003 using in vitro selection.45 The MG aptamer has a KD of 120 nM, and increases the fluorescence of its ligand by 2400-fold (Table 1, No. 1 and 2). 4082 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023The MG aptamer has also been demonstrated to be able to discriminate between MG and its sulfonated analog.45 Although illumination of MG is likely to introduce cell toxicity due to the generation of free radicals,101 making it unsuitable for cell imaging applications, the high FE of this aptamer opened the possibility of developing biologically compatible fluorogenic systems with high affinity and signal contrast. In 2008, Con-stantin et al. synthesized an asymmetric fluorogenic cyanine dye called dimethylindole red (DIR) and selected the RNA aptamer DIR-Apt1 (Table 1, No. 3), with 86 nM KD using affinity-based in vitro selection.48 Upon binding to DIR-Apt1, DIR ligand fluorescence was shown to enhance by 60-fold. DIR does not intercalate non-specifically into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Suppressing non-specific binding to nucleic acids is important to reduce the background fluorescence and to increase the dynamic range in cell imaging. In the same year, Sando et al. developed a fluorescent blue light-up RNA aptamer tag against the Hoechest 1c ligand (Table 1, No. 7). The transcription of mRNA was monitored in vitro using this system by fusing tandem repeated aptamer tags to the 3’ UTR region of the luciferase dsDNA template.51 In contrast to the earlier identified red light-up RNA aptamers, this blue fluorogenic aptamer expanded the RNA detection toolbox and introduced the possi-bility of multi-colour RNA imaging. 4.2 HBI analogs with the ‘‘veggie soup’’ aptamers: Spinach, Broccoli, and Corn Inspired by the structure of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore p-HBI, Paige et al. (Jaffrey lab) in 2011 synthe-sized a series of fluorogenic HBI analogs and selected RNA binding partners with emission wavelengths spanning the visible spectrum using a competitor binding-based elution in vitro selection.37 Among the RNA-fluorophore complexes, the green fluorescent Spinach-DFHBI (Table 1, No. 8) was found to have the most useful photophysical properties. It was character-ized to have a 540 nM KD and 2000-fold FE. X-ray crystallography of the Spinach-DFHBI complex revealed that RNA Spinach contains a rigid two-layer G4 structure that serves as the binding pocket.53 DFHBI stacks on top of the G4 in a planar conformation via hydrophobic interactions and is further con-formationally restricted by a triple base motif above the ligand and a neighbouring nucleotide. Based on this crystal structure, a minimized version ‘‘Baby Spinach’’ (51-nt) was generated with half the size of its original counterpart while still maintaining comparable fluorescence.52 Although having a well-defined binding pocket, the promiscuous RNA Spinach aptamer does not discriminate between small molecule fluorophores (like TO1-B, ThT, and NMM) and can display even higher FE and E with these ligands.39 Being the first successful study using fluorogenic RNA aptamers in cells, the Spinach-DFHBI system has been demonstrated to be compatible with in vivo imaging for both E. coli bacteria and HEK293T eukaryotic cell imaging of 5S RNA.37 In these applications, high concentrations (tens of micromolar concentration) of the cell permeable DFHBI dye are required due to the low affinity binding of the Spinach aptamer. To improve the thermal stability and folding of RNA Spinach in live cells, Strack et al. developed Spinach2 (Table 1, No. 10) by systematic mutational analysis and addressing mismatches within the stem regions found in the original Spinach.38 Compared to Spinach with 32% and 13% folding at 25 1C and 37 1C respectively, Spinach2 (TF = 38 1C) exhibited better folding with 58% and 37% at the same temperatures respec-tively. This improvement resulted in 3-fold brighter fluores-cence for Spinach2 than Spinach in live HEK293T cell imaging. Besides live-cell imaging, an engineered variant called iSpinach (Table 1, No. 11) had been reported by Autour et al. (Ryckelynck lab) for in vitro applications with still higher brightness and thermal stability.32,55 Based on the scaffold of Spinach1.1, which is a parental variant of Spinach 2, a library was generated via error-prone PCR and screened via microfluidic-assisted in vitro selection. Through further miniaturization and engineering, iSpinach was obtained. It is less salt-sensitive and more thermal-stable (TF = 44 1C in presence of potassium ion, TF = 36 1C in presence of sodium ion) than Spinach2, which is more suitable for in vitro transcription conditions. Compared to Spinach2, iSpinach had been demonstrated as a superior RNA concentration indicator to monitor the RNA transcription and iXm1 ribozyme activity in 37 1C potassium-free environment.32 Another green member of the RNA ‘‘vegetable’’ aptamers is Broccoli (Table 1, No. 12), which binds to an improved DFHBI analog (DFHBI-1T),102 developed by Filonov et al. (Jaffrey lab) in 2014 (ref. 41). To optimize the RNA aptamer for use in live cells, the RNA library after in vitro selection was cloned into E. coli bacteria then screened using a FACS-based in vivo selection method. The cell-based screening solved the RNA aptamer misfolding issue present in Spinach and Spinach2 in vivo and resulted in the identification of Broccoli with higher thermal stability (TF = 48 1C) and lower dependence of magnesium for fluorescence than Spinach2. A yellow fluorogenic RNA Corn aptamer had been reported by Song et al. (Jaffrey lab) in 2017 (ref. 57). Compared to DFHBI, the fluorophore ligand DFHO mimics the chromophore of red fluorescent protein (RFP). It contains an elongated p-conjugated system via addition of an acylimine substituent at the C2 position of the imidazoline ring. The Corn:DFHO (Table 1, No. 14) complex exhibits improved photostability in live HEK293T cell imaging compared to Broccoli:DFHBI. One possible explanation for this behaviour being that the photo-bleached product dissociates from Corn allowing a fresh DFHO ligand to bind. Because of its increased photostability, Corn:DFHO system has been utilized for quantitative monitoring of cellular Pol III promoter activity in live HEK293T cells.57 Within the same study, the authors demonstrated that DFHO can also bind to the parental aptamer of Broccoli with more red-shifted emission wavelength (lex = 515 nm, lem = 575 nm) than Corn:DFHO complex (lex = 505 nm, lem = 545 nm). Directed evolution of Broccoli precursor templates resulted in identifi-cation of Orange Broccoli (Table 1, No. 16) and Red Broccoli (Table 1, No. 17). However, the improved photostability of Corn was not preserved in these Broccoli variants, indicating that DFHO is not intrinsically stable, and implies that photostability Review Article Chem Soc Rev Pu bl is he d on  06 Ju ne  202 3.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 | 4083is possibly determined by differing ligand recycling kinetics of these aptamer:ligand complexes. The crystal structure of Corn: DFHO complex reveals an unusual binding mode, with the G4 cores from each of two Corn RNA molecules forming a homo-dimer interface to sandwich one DFHO ligand without any intermolecular base pairs.58 This homodimerization of RNA Corn suggests the potential to design fluorogenic tools for monitoring RNA–RNA interactions. Recently, the RNA Corn aptamer was used to engineer a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosensor for both in vitro and in vivo sensing.103 Kim and co-workers fused the Corn aptamer via a transducer module into the SAM riboswitch aptamer.104 The binding of SAM to the SAM aptamer induces Corn aptamer folding, and consequent dimerization, resulting in a 10-fold fluorescence activation over the SAM minus state. This design demonstrates the potential for increasingly sophisticated genetically encodable RNA-based fluorescent sensors able to detect a broad range of metabolites. 4.3 TO1 analogs with the Mango ‘‘fruit’’ series of aptamers Over the past 30 years, a well-studied unsymmetrical cyanine fluorogenic dye: thiazole orange (TO) has been used broadly as a nucleic acid stain through double-strand intercalation.105 TO consists of a benzothiazole ring and a quinoline ring which are connected via a rotational bridging methine. It gained great interest as a biomolecule for fluorescence sensing, owing to its low background signal and remarkable fluorescence activation upon conformational lock of the rotational methine bond. In 2014, Dolgosheina et al. (Unrau lab) selected the green fluoro-genic RNA MI aptamer against the cell permeable TO1-B with 3.2 nM KD and 1100-fold FE (ref. 34) (Table 1, No. 25). An acetate modification at the N-position of benzothiazole was used, which enables further generation of an amide bond to desta-bilize double-strand intercalation as previously described.106 The unprecedented KD of the MI:TO1-B complex enabled the single-molecule RNA imaging in vitro by TIRF.34 MI also exhi-bits excellent ligand discrimination and does not bind to the Spinach ligand DFHBI.39 The crystal co-structure of MI complex reveals a GAA^A-tetraloop adaptor that connects a closing stem region to a three-tiered G4 binding core.65 The first generation MI:TO1-B complex exhibits a modest quantum yield of 0.14 suggesting room for improvement. The two heterocycles of TO1 are at a 451 degree to each other, suggesting that further improvement of quantum yield could be achieved by minimizing this binding angle.65 This was achieved by microfluidic droplet-based fluorescent selection, where new Mango aptamers 4-fold brighter were isolated.33,66,71 These well-characterized aptamers all contain G4 binding cores and have similar thermal stability (with TF range 40–45 1C), are stabilized strongly by potassium ions and to a lesser extent sodium, while having unique structures that all bind to TO1-B in a substantially planar form. MII shows sub-nanomolar affinity to TO1-B (Table 1, No. 28), and like MI, has a GAA^A tetraloop-like adaptor and a three-tiered G4, where the T3 layer proximal to the TO1 ligand contains four adenine-containing propeller loops,66 flattening the G4 surface and leaving the top of the bound complex open to solvent, perhaps explaining its modest quantum yield of 0.21. Interestingly, both MI and MII are highly resistant to formaldehyde, enabling fixed cell imaging. Incubation with formaldehyde does not interfere with TO1-B binding, even though the top adenine-containing loops with exposed second-ary amines are chemically modified. Crystal structures indicate that the stacked G-tetrad planes are highly impermeable to solvent, demonstrating its importance in fluorophore binding. MIII (Table 1, No. 30–32) displays the brightest fluorescence with an improved quantum yield of 0.56. MIII consists of a two-tiered G4 that sandwiches the TO1-B ligand between a trans base pair. This shielding from solvent, in addition to the planar binding of the TO1-B ligand, may potentially explain the high quantum yield of this system. The crystal structure of MIII reveals that its G4 stacks onto a base triplet that in turn stacks onto the top of a closing helix,33 suggesting that this aptamer rigidly connects its fluorogenic ligand to its external stems. This has been validated by orientation-dependant FRET experiments which make use of the similarly rigid Broccoli aptamer.69 Structure-guided engineering identified an enhanced variant called MIII.1 (Table 1, No. 33–35, previously named MIIIA10U)33 with an improved quantum yield of 0.66 and higher KD (1.5 nM). 70 Structure-guided reselection of MIII resulted in a variant called iMangoIII (iMIII) (Table 1, No. 36) which exhibits an improved FE and quantum yield compared to the MIII wild type.70 However, the reselection failed to identify variants brighter than MIII.I, which suggested that the trans U10NoneU17 base pair stacking on top of TO1-B is optimal for fluorescence brightness.70 MIV (Table 1, No. 37 and 38), which behaves as the brightest variant in fixed cell imaging,71 was determined to be a domain-swapped homodimer in crystallography studies.71 Unlike the Corn:DFHO pair with a 2 : 1 stoichiometric binding ratio,58 MIV binds to TO1-B with a 1 : 1 ratio and the homodimer is linked via a intermolecular helix formed by a palindromic sequence. The intermolecular helix is formed by the first six nucleotides, and the three-tiered G4 binding cores stack coaxially on the ends of the helix without junction connecting the G4 and helix.71 RNA Mango imaging applications of note include the use of the Mango series (II to IV) for imaging the cellular localization of small non-coding RNA.36 In addition to this, MII has been used in various mammalian cell imaging applications including single-molecule tracking of mRNA in live cells alongside the MS2 system demonstrating 2-colour imaging, single-molecule RNA FISH, as well as super-resolution imaging.67 These applications will be discussed in more detail in Section 7.2–7.4. 5. ‘‘Second generation’’ light-up RNA aptamers Over the last 5 years, many new classes of fluorogenic RNA aptamer-ligand systems have been reported. It is important to evaluate these emerging light-up systems not only from the basic photophysical parameters, but also from properties for specific scenarios where the aptamer:ligand systems would be used for. In this section, we will mention the most recent RNA Chem Soc Rev Review Article Pu bl is he d on  06 Ju ne  202 3.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023aptamer:ligand systems with TICT-based fluorophores for multi-colour imaging. In addition to this, burgeoning classes of RNA aptamers based on SP and CQ and their advanced applications will be covered. 5.1 Pairs of aptamer systems with binding and spectral orthogonality The lack of discrimination between specific ligands has delayed the development of orthogonal aptamer-ligand pair systems for multi-colour imaging. As most of the light-up RNA aptamers consist of a G4 binding pocket, this can lead to the promiscuous binding of ligands. There is a demand in the field to engineer orthogonal aptamer systems that can enable simultaneous two-colour imaging. Mango and Peach orthogonal pair. Kong et al. (Unrau lab) selected RNA Peach aptamers (Table 1, No. 39–44) against TO3-B through a competitive denaturing in vitro selection.70 Using unbiotinylated TO1 analogs as the orthogonal competitors in the selection, aptamers able to preferentially bind to TO3-B rather than TO1-B were selected. Compared to the TO1-B specific binder RNA MIII.1 variant (Table 1, No. 33), the selected Peach I (P1) aptamer is 8.3-fold more fluorescently efficient towards TO3-B (Table 1, No. 40) and 270-fold less efficient towards TO1-B (Table 1, No. 39) than MIII.1 (Fig. 3C, blue oval). The binding and spectral orthogonality of Mango and Peach pairs enabled the in vitro quantification of two RNA concentrations simultaneously for concentrations of RNA ranging from 0 to 50 nM, and holds promise for two-colour RNA imaging in vivo. Squash-Broccoli orthogonal pair. Another attempt of engi-neering binding orthogonal pair for dual-colour RNA labelling and imaging is based on the light-up RNA aptamers that activate HBI analogs. In 2021, Dey et al. (Jaffrey lab) evolved RNA Squash, which binds to both DFHBI-1T and DFHO, from the bacterial adenine riboswitch60 (Table 1, No. 18 and 19). They repurposed the parental adenosine riboswitch scaffold61 by randomizing the sequence and length within the adenine-binding pocket. The crystal structures of the RNA Squash: ligand complexes indicate that, instead of harboring a G4, Squash forms a three-way junction to encapsulate it in a largely hydrophobic binding pocket that reduces its solvent accessi-bility and promote RNA:ligand contacts.61 This redesigning of an existing high affinity riboswitch potentially expands the orthogonal toolbox by introducing a novel binding structure. In comparison with Broccoli (Table 1, No. 12), Squash displays a 4.9-fold higher KD towards DFHO (Table 1, No. 19) and 12-fold lower KD to BI (a DFHBI analog). 60 Using this property of selective binding, Dey et al. also demonstrated the combined use of Broccoli:BI and Squash:DFHO as an orthogonal pair of fluorogenic RNA aptamer tags for dual-colour in live-cell imaging.60 Further key photophysical properties of this pair, like molar brightness and FE need to be provided for objective evaluation and comparison with other systems. Corn and Beetroot orthogonal pair. Recently, Wu et al. selected and characterized a red fluorogenic RNA aptamer call RNA Beetroot (Table 1, No. 20 and 21), which can selectively bind a HBI analog: DFAME with a large Stokes shift (lex = 514 nm, lem = 619 nm). 59 Beetroot and Corn pair exhibited orthogonality from the aspects of both KD and FE (Fig. 3C). Using E as a metric, Beetroot is 45-fold more fluorescently efficient than Corn when binding to DFAME (Table 1, No. 20 vs. 15), and Corn is 450-fold more efficient than Beetroot towards DFHO (Table 1, No. 14 vs. 21). Since Beetroot and Corn both form a homodimer, they have been used as tandem repeat tags in live-cell imaging to induce macromolecular assembly via multivalent intermolecular interaction.59 Together with fluorescent proteins, the authors also achieved orthogonal multi-colour imaging of RNA–protein assemblies in HEK293T cells simultaneously. 5.2 Aptamer systems with multi-colour ligands The use of RNA aptamers offers the potential to change the spectral properties of the ligand via chemical modifications to the fluorophore, which do not interfere with binding. Such systems allow the facile switching of spectral properties of the RNA tag simply by changing the fluorogenic ligand. For exam-ple, a MI-tagged 6S RNA construct, normally used with the green TO1-B can be used with the closely related red TO3-B (Fig. 3A and Table 1, No. 25 and 26). It enables two-colour fluorescence cross-correlation measurements with a green GFP-tagged RNA polymerase complex, which fluoresces in the TO1-B colour channel.94 This fluorophore spectral shifting approach enables the rapid optimization of RNA tags for multi-colour imaging with existing FP protein tags. DIR-Pro and OTB-SO3. Using DIR as the target ligand, in 2017, Tan et al. selected a second generation RNA aptamer named DIR2s-Apt49 (Table 1, No. 4–6). This aptamer has demonstrated binding specificity towards DIR, but not to MG. Interestingly, DIR2s-Apt displays binding promiscuity to multi-ple unsymmetrical cyanine dyes, including the red DIR analogs and derivatives of blue fluorophore OTB. Among the cyanine dyes, DIR2s-Apt shows the highest affinity to DIR-Pro (310 nM) and 45-fold FE, whereas it had the largest FE towards OTB-SO3 (70-fold activation) and 740 nM KD. Since the excitation and emission spectra of bound DIR-Pro (lex = 600 nm, lem = 658 nm) and OTB-SO3 (lex = 380 nm, lem = 421 nm) are completely orthogonal, DIR2s-Apt had been used for dual-colour live-cell imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with either red or blue fluorophores. Crystal structures of DIR2s-Apt:OTB-SO3 complex revealed that the aptamer does not contain a G4 binding motif like the previously reported fluorogenic systems,65 which is consistent with the observation that folding is independent to the presence of monovalent cations but dependant on divalent cation concentrations (such as magnesium).49 The binding site adopts a tuning fork-like architecture consisting of two stem-loop, and the loop-loop interactions provides a stacking platform for ligand binding. In addition to the stacking platform, there is only one unpaired adenosine residue that caps the top of the ligand, the promis-cuity of DIR2s-Apt can be explained by the lack of a tight binding pocket and specific intermolecular interactions. Despite the fact that sequential dual-colour imaging had been achieved by using DIR2s-Apt in living A431 mammalian cells, two-colour channel detection cannot be achieved simultaneously and has to be Review Article Chem Soc Rev Pu bl is he d on  06 Ju ne  202 3.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 | 4085stained by using either DIR-Pro or OTB-SO3 sequentially since there is a lack of specificity between the aptamer and ligand. The unique binding structure of DIR2s-Apt might introduce a new prospect of structural-guided engineering of fluorogenic RNA aptamer without G4s, which holds the potential to be further engineered as an orthogonal pair with G4-containing fluorogenic systems such as Spinach, Broccoli, and Mango. Chili system. Based on the HBI chromophore and Spinach system scaffold, Steinmetzger et al. (Höbartner lab) performed structural-guided engineering based on the 13-2 aptamer tem-plate (a variant of Spinach) and identified an aptamer named Chili (Table 1, No. 22–24) which can enhance fluorescence of DMHBI.62 Steinmetzger et al. performed extensive modifica-tions of the ligand in order to create a series of HBI derivatives with large Stokes shifts having yellow to red fluorescence emissions.62,63 Instead of a reselection of the RNA aptamer, 36 HBI fluorophores were screened against RNA Chili aptamer. A set of ligands with an aryl substituent at the N3 position of the imidazoline ring exhibits the brightest fluorescence upon binding to Chili. The best representative with the highest quantum yield of 0.40 was DMHBI+, which exhibited a yellow fluorescent emission and can bind to Chili with 63 nM affinity (Table 1, No. 23). In addition to this, an orange-fluorescent species DMHBO+ displayed the highest affinity towards Chili with 12 nM (Table 1, No. 24). Co-crystal structures of the Chili:ligands complexes suggested that Chili adopts a two-tiered G4 binding pocket.64 DMHBO+ and DMHBI+ show a twisted conformation when bound to Chili, similar to the chromophore structures of long Stokes shift fluorescence pro-tein (e.g., LSSmKate107 and mCRISPred108). The large Stokes shift of this system was explained through excited state proton transfer (ESPT), which describes how the fluorogen undergoes electron rearrangement and energy transfers upon excitation.109 The speculation of ESPT mechanism is supported by structure and time-resolved spectroscopy. Although the applications of Chili and its multi-colour ligands remains to be explored, this study intro-duced new methods of optimization of fluorogenic aptamers by fine-tuning the chromophores via chemical modifications. Pepper system. Also inspired by the work of RNA mimics of GFP,37 in 2019 Chen et al. (Yang lab) designed a GFP chromophore-like synthetic dye (HBC) and selected a fluorogenic RNA aptamer called Pepper35 (Table 1, No. 45–52). Pepper binds to HBC with excellent photophysical properties, including bright green fluorescence, nanomolar KD (3.5 nM), high melting tem-perature (TF B 55 1C), fast association (0.66 None 106 MNone1 sNone1) and slow dissociation rate (0.0023 sNone1). To expand the fluorescence spectral range of Pepper:HBC system, a series of HBC analogs with emission from cyan to red had been synthesized by tuning the electron effects of the p-conjugation system. The HBC analogs all exhibited nanomolar KD and had been used in live 293T/17 cell multi-colour imaging of RNA. The crystal structures of Pepper with each HBC analog show a lack of a G4, instead, Pepper has a double helical tuning-fork-like architecture within its binding pocket that tolerates the modifications of HBC.72 Due to the multi-colour options, high affinity and brightness of this system, Pepper had been employed in various cell imaging applications. For example, imaging of genomic loci using CRISPR display of Pepper,35 Pepper-dependent regulation of protein stabilization,110 and use as a genetically encoded fluor-escent RNA indicator for monitoring RNA translocation and degradation in live HEK293T cells.111 5.3 CQ-based multi-colour fluorogenic aptamers. Another strategy to develop a fluorogenic RNA aptamer is based on a molecular beacon-like mechanism. Instead of binding a specific fluorogenic ligand, the RNA aptamer was selected to bind the contact-quencher conjugated to the fluorogen. In 2015, Arora et al. first reported a RNA aptamer called DNB which to binds to a general dinitroaniline (DN) fluorescence quencher73 (Table 1, No. 53–57). Upon binding of DN to DNB, the fluores-cence of various contact-quenched rhodamine dye-DN conju-gates can be turned on, which provides a versatile platform for changing the spectral properties of the aptamer system. The best conjugates for DNB aptamer system were found to be the yellow TMR-DN (Table 1, No. 55) and yellow SR-DN (Table 1, No. 56) with 350 nM and 800 nM KD, 9.3-and 38-fold FE respectively. With the combined use of the quencher binding DNB aptamer and a fluorogen binding SRB-2 aptamer,28 orthogonal binding and dual-colour imaging has been achieved in E. coli bacteria. Using the same RNA aptamer:quencher binding strategy, in 2018, Braselmann et al. (Palmer lab) utilized the specific high affinity binding of an E. coli cobalamin (CbI, B12) riboswitch112 to its natural CbI ligand and engineered the multi-colour Riboglow platform76 (Table 1, No. 64–65). In this system, the efficient quencher CbI is conjugated with various commercially available fluorophore, including FAM, ATTO series and Cy5. By engineering the quencher-fluorophore linker and mutating the RNA riboswitches, the best pair exhibits 34 nM KD and B5-fold FE (Table 1, No. 65). This Riboglow system has also been used for multi-colour mRNA imaging of stress granules.76 However, the quencher-fluorophore conjugate probe is not cell perme-able and needs to be introduced into cells via mechanical methods (e.g., bead loading). In contrast to developing fluorescence quencher binding RNA aptamers, RhoBAST is a TMR-DN fluorogen binding RNA aptamer that binds to TMR (Table 1, No. 66), which had been reported by Sunbul et al. (Jäschke lab) in 2021 (ref. 77). RhoBAST exhibits excellent brightness (55 000 MNone1 cmNone1), 26-fold FE and 15 nM KD. The aptamer is thermostable with a Tm of 79 1C. Since RhoBAST also displays remarkable photostability and fast ligand exchange kinetics (k 0 On ¼ 1:8None 107 MNone1 sNone1 and k 0 Off ¼ 0:66 sNone1, see Fig. 5B), the blinking properties of this system has been used for super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging of RNA in live HEK293T and HeLa cells as will be discussed subsequently. A new strategy based on contact quenching mechanism is to design the fluorogenic probe which can be self-quenched by dimerization. In 2020, Bouhedda et al. (Ryckelynck lab) selected the RNA aptamer o-Coral which can turn on the fluorescence of a quenched dimerized SRB-derived fluorogen called Gemini-561 (ref. 79) (Table 1, No. 68). Upon binding to o-Coral (KD = 73 nM), Chem Soc Rev Review Article Pu bl is he d on  06 Ju ne  202 3.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023the fluorescence of Gemini-561 increases 13-fold. Recent rational design of the Gemini (called G552alk-C) further improved E with higher KD (7.5 nM) and larger FE (110-fold) 113 (Table 1, No. 69). Despite the large size of the dimerized ligand which potentially could result in poor cell permeability, the Gemini ligand can be introduced into live HEK293T cells successfully with only a 5 min incubation.113 This concept of engineering dimerization-based fluorogenic module provides new guides of engineering ultrabright fluorogenic aptamer-ligand system and is promising for the development of heterodimerization modules. Recently, an avidity-based dimeric aptamer named biRhoBAST78 (Table 1, No. 67) has been reported that it binds towards a fluorogenic bivalent fluorophore TMR2 with KD = 40 pM. Compared to its monomer form (RhoBAST), biRhoBAST exhibits B23 000-fold improved binding affinity. This avidity concept introduces a new versatile strategy which enables engineer tight binding systems using dimerization of previous RNA aptamers. 5.4 SP-based aptamer systems The new concept of fluorogenicity based on the mechanism of spirocyclization has recently been introduced into the field of light-up RNA aptamers. In 2019, Wirth et al. (Jäschke lab) presented a near-infrared RNA aptamer named SiRA which can bind and increase the fluorescence of a spirolactonized silicon-rhodamine dye by shifting the open-closed equilibrium towards the open fluorescent state81 (Table 1, No. 70). The cell perme-ability of this fluorophore, its high brightness and photostability are features of this fluorogenic system. The best characterized pair: SiRA*2 complex, with a TF of 47 1C, shows a remarkable quantum yield of 0.98 in its bound form and has been used in super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) micro-scopy imaging of mRNA in E. coli bacteria (see Section 7.4: Super-resolution imaging of RNA for details). The relative weak binding (KD = 430 nM) and low FE (7-fold) may limit its sensitivity in certain applications. Selection of aptamers against some recent spirorhodamine dyes,26,114 whose equilibrium favours the closed non-fluorescent state, could further improve the fluorescent efficiency of such systems in the future. Using a similar strategy, in 2021, Zhang et al. engineered a colour-shifting fluorogenic RNA aptamer module: BeCA-BC82 (Table 1, No. 71). The closed form of BC fluorogen is a cyan fluorescent species which switches into an open form with near-infrared fluorescence upon binding to BeCA RNA aptamer. BeCA was characterized to binds to the BC6 ligand with a KD of 220 nM and exhibits a 15-fold ratiometric change (cyan/NIR emission ratio change). Although this system still faces the issue of relatively low dynamic range of FE, the colour-shifting module successfully expands the toolbox of fluorescent RNA live-cell imaging and is promising to be used for site-specific RNA labelling in situ. 6. In vitro applications A key advantage of fluorogenic aptamers is that fluorescence signal is effectively created by the transcription of the RNA aptamer allowing the detection of RNAs as they are produced, with fluorescence proportional to the amount of RNA. For aptamers with slow off-rates, purification of tagged RNAs is also enabled. By using pairs of fluorogenic aptamers, two-colour reporters can be generated with numerous applications. In this section we, for reasons of space, none exhaustively review some of the many applications of fluorogenic aptamers. 6.1 Transcriptional reporter assays By tagging DNA with a fluorogenic aptamer, in vitro and in vivo transcriptional reporter assays have proven particularly simple to implement as the act of transcription results in an RNA product that can be detected by addition of the fluorogenic ligand (Fig. 7A). Fluorogenic aptamers have been used to detect a broad range of transcriptional activities in vitro that range from lucifer-ase transcription monitoring51 using blue fluorescent RNA (Table 1, No. 7), iXm ribozyme activity detection32 using iSpinach (Table 1, No. 11) to steroid induction of mRNA via MII (Table 1, No. 25).115 These examples suggest that the fluorogenic tag fusion method can be used for precise quantification of ROI, and its sensitivity is comparable to traditional methods like non-specific RNA dye staining and RT-PCR. More importantly, it features site-specific labelling and real-time monitoring in native biological contexts, which broadens in vivo applications with higher complexity. In the cell, Corn and Pepper systems have been used to report on RNA function and metabolism by monitoring the suppression of polymerase III transcription, the spatial translocation of ribonucleic anti-terminator (RAT) RNA element and RNA degradation caused by barnase nuclease activation.57,111 By incorporating fluorogenic aptamers into ROI, this allows for a wide variety of assays that measure transcrip-tional activities both temporally and spatially. 6.2 RNP complex purification Certain classes of fluorogenic RNA aptamers may prove to have a significant advantage over existing purification methods116 for the recovery of high purity native RNP complexes. While the development of high-throughput formaldehyde and UV cross-linking methods have uncovered many RNA-binding proteins and miRNA–protein complexes, the covalent modifications that occur in these methods preclude downstream biochemical studies. High purity native complexes are required in many applications that include the detailed biochemical and structural characterization of RNP complexes and screening for inhibition of complex function via the use of small molecule libraries. In addition to RNA imaging, ROI-tagged fluorogenic aptamers that have slow off-rates for their fluorogenic ligands offer the potential for RNA–protein complex pulldowns (Table 1, pull-down in ‘‘Properties’’ column indicated by ‘P’). Selections using competitive binding strategies and long washing steps have resulted in very slow off-rates (characteristic times of half a day), which enable applications including tagged RNA pulldown, RNP purification, and gel shift experiments. Using CRISPR gene modification technology,117 biologically compatible slow off-rate fluorogenic aptamers can be geneti-cally encoded into endogenous ROI to allow for the purification Review Article Chem Soc Rev Pu bl is he d on  06 Ju ne  202 3.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 | 4087of high purity native RNP complexes using simple purification protocols.68 The insertion of a fluorogenic tag first allows the spatial and temporal dynamics of the RNP complex to be visualized in either fixed or living cells. Then, and as discussed in Section 2 of this review, nearly all fluorogenic aptamers have been selected by immobilizing the fluorogenic ligand onto a solid support using a biotin tag through a flexible linker. Chan-ging this biotin conjugated to the fluorophore to desthiobiotin provides a pulldown method by affinity-based elution (Fig. 7B). This method is directly competitive with other aptamer-based RNP purification methods such as the native streptavidin binding S1 aptamer recovery protocol.118 An additional benefit to the use of fluorogenic aptamers is that the recovered RNP complex still contains the bound fluorophore. This allows for the fluorescent visualization of the complex through gel shift experiments and further purification by size exclusion chromatography. The MI and MIII aptamers have been used to demonstrate such approaches in bacteria.68,94 Recently, the 6S RNA was CRISPR-tagged with MIII and used to image 6S accumulation in stationary phase. Tagged 6S complexes were then purified 4088 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023from bacteria as a function of growth condition and the product RNAs formed in the 6S:RNAP complex were characterized.68 Previously, a MI-tagged plasmid expressing 6S RNA was used to rapidly obtain high purity 6S:RNAP complex by a pull down, size exclusion purification scheme. Mass spectrometry analysis of the recovered bacterial RNA polymerase found it to be as pure as NEB holoenzyme.94 Low off-rates also enable rapid native PAGE RNP gel shift methods as staining of the RNP with free fluorogenic ligand is not typically required.119,120 6.3 Isothermal amplification reporter assays. The recent COVID19 pandemic has pointed out the difficulty of detecting nucleic acids at the attomolar concentration (Bone template molecule per microlitre), which is the practical limit of detection of viral RNAs in saliva. This remains a difficult problem that has been practically solved to date by a range of amplification methods. RT-PCR is the dominant technology in this area, but requires a device capable of thermocycling in non-laboratory settings. Isothermal methods able to amplify very low concentrations of RNA are fortunately fully compatible with the use of fluorogenic aptamers as transcriptional RNA reporters. This results in a significantly simpler design for the in vitro detection of nucleic acids. For example, NASBA (Nonenucleic Noneacid Nonesequence-Nonebased Noneamplification) can amplify RNA with great specificity in a one pot reaction by addition of two DNA primers (primer A and B) and a three-enzyme mix. First, reverse tran-scriptase (RT) makes an RNA:DNA heteroduplex, by addition of primer A encoding a T7 promoter. This step is followed by RNA degradation, using RNaseH, to allow top strand primer B (encoding the fluorogenic aptamer tag) to anneal and be extended by RT into a duplex DNA that can now be transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. The exponentially enriched RNA, can then be quantified by fluorescence read-out of the aptamer allowing for picomolar detection sensitivities with multichan-nel capabilities121 (Fig. 7C). By performing a nested isothermal reaction, attomolar sensitivities were simple to obtain.122 As such reagents are easily lyophilized, portable detection kits are likely to be developed commercially. Such methods appear to be competitive with other isothermal technologies such as Sherlock.123 6.4 Logical toggle switches The creation of fluorescence by transcription is a potent strength of fluorogenic aptamer systems. Here we focus on two specific examples that can formally be classified as logical gates; where two polymer inputs are ’processed’ to provide a two-state fluor-escent readout signal. While still in their infancy, it is easy to imagine how such circuits could be expressed in living cells in the future. Fig. 7D show a logical ‘AND’ gate. By splitting the Broccoli aptamer into two parts, fluorescence is only obtained if both top and bottom strands are expressed allowing the formation of the fluorescent complex.124 To utilize the Broccoli RNA aptamer to detect and visualize RNA–RNA interactions, a split version called ‘‘Split-Broccoli’’ has been designed by Alam et al.124 The assembly of the ‘‘top’’ and ‘‘bottom’’ strands reconstitutes the Broccoli by increasing the fluorescence 186-fold in vitro. Using this system, mCherry expression level in E. coli has been regulated together with a use of toehold switch containing the top strand at the 5’ end of the open reading frame (ORF). Upon binding of the bottom strand to the top strand, the ribosomal binding site (RBS) sequestered by the toehold switch is exposed and activated for downstream translation.124 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 | 4089(ref. 127). FRET, however, is intrinsically very sensitive to changes in angular orientation in instances where the FRET donor and acceptor are rigidly connected to the biomolecule under investigation.128 These two aspects of FRET make it of high relevance to RNA sensor design and for cellular reporters as RNA structures with multiple conformational states often induce changes in helical stacking angles. The development of orthogonal fluorogenic aptamers promises to not only enable the use of RNA–RNA FRET within living cells, but also the detection of angular changes in RNA complexes. Mango–Spinach FRET pairs. In 2018, Jepsen et al. developed aptamer-dependent FRET (apta-FRET).54 It has been demonstrated in a range of artificial RNA structures where RNA–RNA FRET measurements were performed using MI:YO3-Biotin (Table 1, No. 27) as a FRET acceptor and Spinach:DFHBI-1T as a FRET donor54 (Fig. 8A). In addition to the spectral overlap between the two fluorogenic ligands (Fig. 8Aii), MI can specifically bind to TO-based ligands while rejecting the DFHBI-1T ligand.39 Due to differences in KD between MI and Spinach for their target ligand (26 nM versus 340 nM respectively, Table 1, No. 9 and 27), low concentrations of YO3-B were used to saturate the MI binding pocket meanwhile leaving the Spinach binding pocket available to be saturated with much higher concentrations of DFHBI-1T (ref. 54). By optimizing the spacer length between the two, the maximum FRET value was reported to be B0.6 (ref. 54). Since the GAA^A tetraloop-like adaptor of MI is conformationally flexible,65 the FRET acceptor is rotationally averaged in these experiments (Fig. 9A–C). This renders the system similar to conventional distance-dependent FRET where synthesized chromophores are typically chemically attached to targets of interest via floppy linker motifs. This FRET system was used in conjunction with a SAM riboswitch to detect SAM concentrations in vitro, with a KD of 17 micromolar for SAM. 54 More recently, by removing the palindromic sequence found in homodimer interface of MIV, a heterodimer-based FRET pair had been designed that combines the iSpinach:DFHBI-1T and MIV:YO3-B pairs71 into a FRET system. An application for this heterodimer complex remains to be demonstrated. Mango–Broccoli orientation-dependent FRET pairs. Orientation-dependent FRET enables the study of bimolecular interactions with the advantage of focusing on angular conformational changes. For example, conformational changes in the spliceo-some are understood from cryo-EM studies to involve helical motions,129,130 that could be studied with orientation-dependent FRET. Likewise, protein synthesis involves angular oscillations between the large and small ribosomal subunits131 which has been previously studied with distance-dependant FRET132 but could be more precisely monitored by orientation-dependant FRET. Oriented FRET has traditionally been very difficult to achieve, but has been enabled in vitro by the development of rigid fluorogenic aptamers. RNA MIII stacks its fluorogenic G4-based binding domain on top of a base triple which in turn stacks on top of a closing RNA helix33 (Fig. 9D–F). This rigidly connects the fluorogenic ligands of MIII to an arbitrary RNA helix allowing it to communicate the angular orientation of this helix fluorescently. Similarly, RNA Broccoli rigidly connects its fluorogenic binding pocket to helixes above and below the pocket which also allows this fluorogenic aptamer to report angular orientation. MIII binds to YO3-B with much higher affinity than Broccoli (11 nM versus 910 nM),69 allowing for a similar methodology as described previously where low concentrations of YO3-B and high concentrations of DFHBI-1T were used (ref. 54 and 69) (Table 1, No. 12 and 32). Using this rigid apta-FRET system, with DFHBI-1T as the FRET donor and YO3-B as the FRET acceptor, the spectral overlap enabled angular-dependent FRET measurements for a range of helical lengths between the acceptor and donor (Fig. 8Bi). As crystal structures suggest, both the acceptor dipole and donor dipoles are nearly perpendicular to their helical stems in an initial construct where a helical duplex rigidly connects the two aptamers.69 By extension, and consequently rotation, of this connecting duplex, regular oscillations in FRET efficiency (E 0 FRET) can be observed (Fig. 8Bi, ii). In these series of constructs, the dipoles, which are nearly perpendicular to the helical axis, are rotated with respect to each other around the helical displacement axis. The modelled orientation factor was observed as first being parallel (k2 B 1), then perpendicular (k2 B 0), then antiparallel (k2 B 1) with a decrease in E’FRET intensity as the helical distance between the two dipoles increases (Fig. 8Bii, iii). Rigid fluorogenic aptamers could also be used to monitor the folding of the nickel/cobalt riboswitch, where two stem loops within the structure become parallel upon binding of either metal ion133 (Fig. 8Biv, v). By systematically varying the insertion location of each aptamer, sets of orientation-dependent FRET measurements could be collected.69 Such FRET measurements are compatible with the design of cell-based sensors, but eukar-yotic cell-based oriented-FRET designs have yet to be reported. 7.2 Two-colour RNA sensors and RNA–protein imaging Due to the intrinsic difficulty in interpreting the meaning of a single channel fluorescence signal, two-channel fluorescence cap-abilities are very important for calibrating fluorescence signals. This is particularly important for sensors that need to function within the complex environment of a living cell. While the field of RNA sensors is still in its infancy, we report the use of pairs of fluorogenic aptamer systems with demonstrated two-colour RNA– RNA or RNA–protein imaging capabilities either in vivo or in vitro. These examples suggest the future potential of such methods for the routine reporting of cellular state by fluorescent RNA reporters. A particular focus is placed on those applications capable of reporting cellular properties with accuracy and precision. Ratiometric Mango-SRB2 sensor for miRNA detection in live cells. The intrinsic binding orthogonality between the TICT-based MI and the CQ-based SRB2 aptamer (Table 1, No. 25 and 63) was used by Dou et al. to generate a ratiometric sensor able to report the concentration of mi-224 within HeLa cells.134 This sensor consists of an internal reference module containing MI and a SRB2-derived sensing module in which fluorescence can be activated by addition of target mi-224 RNA. These two modules were linked together by a dsRNA Dicer substrate and Chem Soc Rev Review Article Pu bl is he d on  06 Ju ne  202 3.

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023under a single expression promotor (Fig. 8C). In a range of cell lines, a linear correlation between the SRB2 miRNA sensor signal to the MI reference was observed over one order of magnitude of mir-224 concentration range as determined by qRT-PCR.134 The authors also demonstrated that there was no FE detected for either MI:TO1-B or SRB2:SR-DN system both in vitro and in living cells when they were fused directly. This finding can be possibly explained by the misfolding of the two modules, due to proximal interaction, which demonstrates the requirement for structural rational design of biosensors. TICT-based orthogonal fluorogenic aptamer pairs for two-colour imaging. Spectral, FE, and binding affinity orthogonality is desired for site-specific multi-colour imaging and detection. As described previously (see Section 5.1), most of TICT-based light-up RNA aptamers harbour a G4 binding core, that lacks ligand discrimination abilities on its own. There are only a few studies that have demonstrated the success of two-colour RNA– RNA imaging in living cells using TICT-based RNA aptamers. For example, Dey et al. have generated a SAM target ratiometric sensor where a G4-based Broccoli:BI (Table 1, No. 13) was used as an internal reference and a non-G4-based Squash-SAM:DFHO (derived from Table 1, No. 19) was used as a sensing module.60 In this sensor, the green channel Broccoli:BI is inserted in one arm of the F30 aptamer scaffold, based on a highly stable viral three-way junction RNA motif,135 and the orange channel Squash-SAM:DFHO is inserted in another arm. The ratiometric signals monitored in cells correlate with the biochemical mea-surements of SAM levels, which demonstrates the use of this sensor for quantitative metabolite detection. However, further photophysical characterization of this system needs to be pro-vided. The highly spectral overlap between the BI and DFHO should be considered, whether it is compatible with commonly used filter sets on research microscopes and whether spectral deconvolution is necessary. Recently, another spectral and binding orthogonal pair Beetroot:DFAME and Corn:DFHO (Table 1, No. 20 and 14, Fig. 3C, highlighted in orange oval) has been used to visualize orthogonal RNA–protein assemblies in cells simultaneously.59 Since both Beetroot and Corn aptamers are homodimers, they enable the formation of orthogonal macromolecular assem-blies through dimerization interactions upon tagging multiple copies of each aptamer on the ROI. These RNA assemblies can not only be visualized by the fluorescence of RNA tags, but can also form larger RNA–protein assemblies by recruiting specific protein partners upon the combined use of the MS2-MCP and boxB-N-peptide systems. The constructs encoding 5 None Corn-MS2 and its binding partner MCP-mCherry, as well as 5 None Beetroot-boxB and its binder GFP-N-peptide, are all co-expressed in cells to simultaneously image the orthogonal assemblies. The ortho-gonality of the two RNP assembly species was demonstrated by the evidence that there was no observed co-localization of red and green fluorescent puncta labelled with mCherry and GFP respectively. Despite these initial multi-colour cell imaging examples, there is still growing demand for new fluorogenic RNA aptamer pairs with well-characterized spectral, binding and FE orthogonality. As promising candidates, the MIII.1 and P1 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 | 4091pair (Fig. 3C, highlighted in blue oval) has demonstrated its orthogonality of E. However, the dual colour imaging of this pair in living cells needs to be further explored. RNA aptamer-FP fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a com-paratively simple and underutilized methodology to measure the concentration and diffusive properties of fluorescently tagged particles either in living cells or in cellular extracts. As an early FCS example using a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, the specific binding of ligand sulforhodamine B to SRB2-tagged mRNA was tested in the presence of total RNA Cos-7 cell extracts.136 Two-colour FCS (or FCCS) extends the capabilities of this methodology to allow the facile measurement of particle colocalization, binding stoichiometries, and biomolecule folding efficiency.137 Using MI:TO3-B (Table 1, No. 26) tagged 6S regulatory RNA and fusion RNA polymerase-EGFP, the asso-ciation of this RNP complex could be observed using two-photon FCCS in bacterial cell extracts.94 Another example of FCCS was to study the folding efficiency of the Broccoli aptamer. The fluor-escent signal from DFHBI-1T (Table 1, No. 12) was correlated with signal from a ATTO647N covalently linked to the aptamer distal to the ligand binding pocket.138 This technology requires the aptamer:ligand system to have slow exchange kinetics com-pared to the characteristic autocorrelation timescale of the FCCS experiment, which is likely to be met by many of the fluorogenic aptamers in Table 1. It can be simply adapted for cellular imaging and promises to yield many applications in eukaryotic cells. 7.3 Single-molecule RNA detection in live and fixed cells Understanding how RNAs move and interact with other bio-molecules within a living eukaryotic cell is fundamental to understanding the many complex mRNA regulatory processes starting from its initial creation in the nucleus till its death in the cytoplasm. To date, three fluorogenic aptamer systems (two TICT and one CQ-based aptamers) have demonstrated single-molecule RNA detection in live mammalian tissue culture. Such imaging requires a complex optimization between the fluoro-genic system, the biology of the cell, and the microscope used to image the sample being studied. Many of the known biolo-gical constraints are summarized in Fig. 6 and a detailed analysis of the fluorophore/microscope constraints is beyond the scope of this review. It is essential to note that imaging contrast, directly related to E of light-up RNA aptamer systems, plays a critical role. Interestingly, the Mango and RiboGlow aptamers used for live cell imaging are quite resistant to formal-dehyde fixation, making these live cell imaging tools also useful for more routine spatial imaging of RNA within fixed cells. For context, we introduce the gold standard MS2 single-molecule RNA imaging system before discussing each of the fluorogenic aptamer imaging systems. MS2-based system. The MS2-MCP system developed by the Singer group, has been used extensively to image cellular RNAs.4,139 FP-based RNA tags have low contrast as the intrinsic fluorescence of the FP-MCP reporter, which need not be asso-ciated with the tagged ROI, is always present.140 For imaging of RNAs in the cytoplasm, this effect can be partially mitigated by 4092 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023fusing nuclear localization tags to the FP-MCP RNA imaging report, allowing for higher contrast visualization of weak fluor-escent signals within the cytoplasm.141 This system is known to decrease the stability of mRNA within eukaryotic cells but recently improved versions appear to address this effect.142 FP-based methods also suffer further from comparatively slow oxygen-dependent maturation times of the fluorogenic centre.2 For all of these reasons, fluorogenic aptamers offer the potential to offer complementary and potentially competitive solutions to RNA imaging in live cells. These include potentially higher contrast imaging and ease of use. TICT-based Broccoli live cell imaging. To increase the stability of the Broccoli aptamer, it was incorporated into the F30 scaffold. Broccoli was placed into the F30 scaffold such that four copies were present, two such F30 constructs were in turn concatenated as shown in Fig. 10A, either once, twice or three times (8, 16, or 24 Broccoli monomers).56 The F30 repeat structure containing 24 aptamer copies RNA was 65% as bright as would have been expected from the brightness of 24 indivi-dual Broccoli aptamers, suggesting the presence of either misfolding or contact homo resonance energy (RE) quenching in such designs.56 This construct, when expressed in Cos-7 cells, lead to the observation of mobile fluorescent puncta (Fig. 10B). The half-life of these puncta, after the addition of actinomycin D (an inhibitor of transcription) together with the aggregation of these puncta into larger stress granules after arsenite or cold shock, was consistent with these puncta representing single-molecule RNAs.56 While fluorescence puncta were detected and This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 | 4093suggested to be single mRNA molecules, no tracking of indivi-dual particles were performed in this study. A key feature of this imaging was the staining of live cells with 10 micromolar of the BI ligand, which enabled imaging of puncta that could not be observed with DFHBI-1T (Table 1, No. 12 and 13). Broccoli binding to BI rather than to DFHBI-1T improved 1.88-fold brightness and gave a 6-fold higher binding affinity. A direct comparison of this system to the MS2 gold standard would be very useful to fully establish the potential of this system. TICT-based MII live and fixed cell imaging. The extremely high E of the MII aptamer enabled single mRNA imaging and tracking in live and fixed Cos-7/HEK293T cells.36,67 A core repeat of 3 None MII aptamers, each having distinct closing stem sequences, was 80% as bright as expected from three separate monomers, suggesting modest homo-RE based quenching or misfolding. This triplex unit was concatenated and a linear increase in fluorescence was observed, again, suggesting that the triplex was stable against higher order misfolding issues. Cos-9 cells transformed and induced with plasmids containing 8 repeats of this triplex (24 None MII aptamers total) produced puncta when stained with 200 nM TO1-B. Using a widefield fluorescence microscope, such puncta were observable both in fixed and live cells. The Mango signal was stable under pulsed illumination in both fixed and live cells. To perform two-colour imaging using both light-up RNA aptamer technology and FP-based RNA imaging methods, an ROI was dually tagged with MII and the MS2 binding motif. A third plasmid was then created that express a mRNA containing 8 copies of the MII triplex (24 None MII aptamers) and 24 copies of the MS2 binding motif (Fig. 10C). A construct encoding NLS-tdMCP-mCherry served to report the MS2 portion of the transcript. Fixing with 4% formaldehyde resulted in clear coloca-lization of puncta in the TO1-B and mCherry imaging channels, extending previous fixed cell dual RNA imaging using MII and immunostaining.36 In live cells, co-localization was again observed by comparing trajectories. Single particles were tracked for sustained periods of time (30 s) in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus67 (Fig. 10D). The 24 None MII tag was then used to demon-strate that the coding b-actin and noncoding NEAT-1 correctly localized when using this imaging tag. 7.4 Super-resolution imaging of RNA. The fluorophore recycling feature of some fluorogenic aptamer systems (Fig. 5) promises many super-resolution applications in the future. Here, we summarize the observed fluorogenic recy-cling properties of aptamer systems and the super-resolution imaging results generated to date. Super-resolution imaging of RNA requires a combination of advanced microscopy and fluorogenic RNA methods. As this research area advances, more results are expected to be forthcoming in the future. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) using TICT-based Pepper:HBC620. The Yang laboratory developed the Pepper system, which is capable of photoexchange (Fig. 5) in live cells.35 Illumination with intense 458 nm laser light for approxi-mately 10 s resulted in rapid photobleaching that regenerated nearly completely after 60 s in the dark. This regeneration of fluorescence was observed for 5 cycles with nearly complete regeneration being observed.35 The imaging properties of the Pepper:HBC620 system (Table 1, No. 52), proved to be superior to Broccoli:DFHBI-1T (Table 1, No. 12) and Pepper:HBC530 (Table 1, No. 50). It was used to perform SIM on cells where MS2-tagged Pepper:HBC620 (Table 1, No. 52) was tethered to a MCP-BFP-histone fusion protein. Excellent colocalization of the Pepper:HBC620 and BFP was observed using 3D-SIM, pointing out the power of this imaging system.35 SIM using TICT-based MII. Analysis of MII None 24 containing puncta within formaldehyde fixed HEK293T cells revealed the fluorescent regeneration properties of the MII:TO1-B system (Fig. 5 and Table 1, No. 28). Using potassium-containing PKM buffer, required for MII G4 folding, supplemented with TO1-B, puncta could be photobleached within 5 s of confocal illumination. Nearly full recovery of fluorescence was observed after 5 s in the dark. Such cycles of could be repeated at least 700 times with only a minor loss in total observed fluorescence being observed.67 In contrast, Alexa Fluor 647 had photobleached to 40% of its original intensity. Permeability of fresh TO1-B was required for this effect as addition of a solid phase ProLong Diamond fixative did not result in fluorescent regeneration. This suggested that the photon budget of the MII system could be considerably extended, consistent with the long imaging times of RNA within live cells using MII.67 In addition to this, structured illumination could resolve structures at a 100 nm length scale, where colocalization was observed between MII tagged NEAT-1, which is known to localize in nuclear paraspeckles, and NONO protein immuno-stained with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated antibody.67 Stimulated emission depletion (STED) using SP-based SiRA. Using spirocyclization, the Jäschke group demonstrated live cell STED using the SiRA imaging system with a far-red fluorophore (Fig. 10E and Table 1, No. 70).81 The photoexchange properties of this system (k 0 On ¼ 6:5None 103 MNone1 sNone1, k 0 Off ¼ 2:8None 10None3 sNone1, 4094 | Chem.

Outlook Over the past decade, the rapid development of diverse fluoro-genic aptamer systems (Table 1) has led to a broad range of RNA tools for in vivo and in vitro use. As the fluorogenic aptamer field continues to mature, the applications for these exciting RNA research tools will continue to grow. Clearly as this field advances, more standardization, multi-channel ima-ging systems, and biological testing will be required to move to a truly ’plug and play’ set of tools for routine RNA research. 8.1 Standardization of reporting for new fluorogenic aptamer systems The application of in vitro selection to RNA imaging tools is relatively recent, but many of the lessons learned from studying naturally occurring and artificial aptamers as well as ribozymes needs to be more uniformly applied to facilitate the development of RNA fluorogenic aptamers. Some key aspects are included here. Aptamer minimization and binding motif stability. It is important that new aptamer motifs be minimized and that the potential interaction of external sequences with the core aptamer sequence responsible for ligand binding be explored in greater detail. The existence of closing external stems in most characterized fluorogenic aptamers, is perhaps surpris-ing, but appears to serve the role of isolating the fluorogenic ligand binding core from random sequence domains during in vitro selection. They may also serve the additional, if inad-vertent, purpose of isolating fluorogenic aptamer binding domains from biological sequences. Such interactions between fluorogenic aptamers and external sequences need to be explored in much greater detail. Similarly, the effect of RNA helicases in eukaryotic cells and their effects on RNA G4 unfolding98 implies a direct effect on aptamer fluorescence, but remains to be resolved by the community. Similarly, the measuring how aptamers misfold is important to measure in vitro. Comparing fluorescence signals resulting from an excess of aptamer to that of an excess of fluorophore provides one way of studying such issues and should be routinely implemented. Perhaps most obviously, the exact sequence of the minimal aptamer sequence should be clearly presented to enable utilization by others. Binding properties. The measurement of binding affinities together with on-and off-rates will be increasingly important. Such measurements can be extremely challenging. High affinity (nM) aptamers require careful fitting procedures, which are starting to be routinely used in the field.34,77 Off-rates can be challenging to measure, particularly for low off-rate aptamers where 1 None k 0 Off can be on the order of half a day. The use of standard methodologies to measure off-rates (for example, BiaCore143) may have complex ramifications for understanding off-rates in a biological contexts. This is particularly important with the consideration that nearly all aptamers are selected against solid supports. More routine mea-surements of k 0 On, using methods that include stop flow, together with the measurement of KD should be used to estimate k 0 Off . For the most accurate measurement of association and dissociation rate constants, the single-molecule microscopy assay can achieve near-molecular resolution by fitting the fluorescence blinking into a kinetic model.144,145 Measuring such properties in buffers that simulate the cellular environment are highly desirable. In addition to binding kinetics, the characterizations of a new fluorogenic aptamer should also include pH dependence, particularly over the range commonly used in vitro (pH 6 to 9), as well as metal ion dependence (Mg2+, K+, Na+) are of particular importance for in vivo work together with their corresponding Hill coefficients and chemical stability (such as resistance to formaldehyde and/or formamide). 8.2 Biological testing and pairwise technological comparisons While adding significant work load, research groups should also be encouraged to directly compare the spectral orthogon-ality and biochemical fluorogenic properties of any new fluoro-genic aptamer systems with existing fluorogenic aptamers. This will become increasingly important as more two-or even three-channel RNA imaging systems are developed in the future. Such experiments are first most usefully performed in vitro but can be challenging if fluorophores are not easily available. Testing the biological compatibility of fluorogenic aptamer systems should be made to existing RNA imaging systems of the sort discussed in this review. Again, this is an extremely challenging subject that depends sensitively on the microscope infrastructure and the details of each fluorogenic system being used. Co-localization of fluorogenic aptamers with competing technologies should be used extensively to make direct com-parisons in a meaningful fashion and such comparisons are indeed starting to be made. The development of standards for single-molecule RNA and super resolution imaging involving fluorogenic regeneration will help ensure the progress of high-quality fluorescent imaging within the light-up RNA aptamer community. Using these standards, RNA imaging methods will become routinely useful to the biological research community. For such fluorogenic aptamer systems, care should be taken to point out potential compatibilities and incompatibilities with biological imaging applications at the time of publication. 8.3 Moving to routine use ‘plug and play’ technology The routine imaging of cellular RNAs at the single-molecule level is now within the technological scope of the fluorogenic aptamer field. This new technology complements very well to the existing chemical and FP colour palettes, which have proven to be invaluable for the study of protein localization both in vitro and within living cells. Just as with FPs, more time is required for this existing field to fully mature. In addition to the demonstrated in vitro applications of these technologies in an ‘off the shelf’ format, further optimization of this technology will lead to many biological ‘plug and play’ applications.

Unrau *The field of fluorogenic RNA aptamers is a burgeoning research area that aims to address the lack of naturally fluorescent RNA molecules for RNA detection and imaging. These small RNA tags bind to their fluorogenic ligands resulting in significant fluorescent enhancement, leading to a molar brightness comparable to or exceeding that of fluorescent proteins. In the past decade, multiple light-up RNA aptamer systems have been isolated that bind to a broad range of ligands involving several distinct mechanisms of fluorogenicity. This review discusses the selection methods used to isolate fluorogenic RNA aptamers. More than seventy fluorogenic aptamer:ligand pairs are evaluated using objective parameters (e.g., molar brightness, binding affinity, fluorophore exchange capabilities and other details). General guidelines for choosing fluorescent RNA tools, with an emphasis on single-molecule detection and multi-colour imaging applications are provided. Lastly the importance of global standards for evaluating fluorogenic RNA aptamer systems is discussed.",
        "1. Introduction The fluorescent imaging of biomolecules together with a broad range of fluorescence detection methodologies has paved the way for powerful discoveries in the biological sciences. Directly visualizing biological processes with light is a minimally invasive method that provides insight into the complex inner workings of life. The central importance of RNA in cellular processes and disease has resulted in a burgeoning field of fluorescent light-upRNA aptamer tools (FLAPs, also referred to as fluorogenic RNA aptamers). These RNA imaging tools are now approaching and, in some cases, exceeding the capabilities of protein-based fluor-escent imaging. As a result, they show great promise to truly integrate proteomic and transcriptomic studies.",
        "Historically, tremendous efforts have been made to develop the naturally occurring fluorescent proteins (FP) into valuable fluorescent tagging tools. First described in 1994, the study and application of green FP (GFP)1–3 as a genetically encodable FP tag, paved the way for the engineering of a broad colour palette of FPs that span the visible light spectrum.3 In addition to studying gene expression and cellular protein localization,2,4 biotechnological developments have resulted in a range ofDepartment of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.

Applications range from genetically encoded protein biosensors for voltage,5 calcium,6 and potassium7 to sensors able to measure NADPH,8 citrate9 and L-lactate10 concentrations. However, these fluorescence-based protein biotechnologies preclude the ability to study RNA-dependent processes easily. This is particularly critical as transcription, RNA maturation, RNA regulation, and transla-tional processes all depend on RNA, with many more RNAs being transcribed than being translated.11 While FPs have enabled spatial and dynamic studies of the proteome and cellular state, there is yet to be discovered an intrinsically fluorescent biological RNA counterpart to study the transcrip-tome and RNA-dependent processes in vitro and in vivo. While general nucleic acid and RNA-selective fluorogenic stains have been reported,12–15 these fluorophores lack the specificity required to image individual RNA species within a cell. Currently, there are multiple distinct strategies for the fluorescent labelling of specific RNA species in vitro and in vivo. Using chemical modifications, fluorophores are typically covalently attached to nucleic acid, either internally or at the 50or 30 end.16 These exogenous nucleic acid probes are tradi-tionally used in methods such as molecular beacons17 and smFISH,18 which allows for in vitro detection and fixed cell imaging respectively. The disadvantages of these tools are that they are neither genetically encodable nor cell permeable. In contrast to these in vitro methods, the current gold standard for in vivo RNA imaging is the MS2-MCP system4,19 and the closely related systems (e.g., PP7-PCP,20 U1A-U1Ap21 and boxB-N peptide22). Tagging an RNA of interest (ROI) with a specific MS2 sequence able to bind tightly to the MS2 coat protein (MCP), allows a FP to be recruited specifically to an ROI by fusing the FP to MCP (FP-MCP).4,19 However, this FP-reliant method can suffer from high background fluorescence due to unbalanced RNA and protein expression levels. As a result, the field of fluorogenic RNA aptamers has emerged in order to develop RNA counterparts to FPs to address these disadvantages. In these light-up RNA aptamer systems, specific RNA sequences termed RNA aptamers, bind and thus dramatically enhance the fluorescence of a fluorogenic ligand that is exogen-ous to the biological system (Fig. 1A). As a result, the efficiency ofthese two component systems is greatly dependent on the detailed characteristics of both the RNA aptamer and its cognate fluorogenic ligand. Ideally the pair must achieve a high molar fluorescent brightness (MNone1 cmNone1), while doing so with high specificity to enable multi-colour imaging. To date, light-up RNA aptamer systems exploit three general mechanisms of fluoro-genicity: Nonetwisted Noneintramolecular Nonecharge Nonetransfer (TICT), 23,24 Nonecontact Nonequenching (CQ), 25 and NonesNonepirolactonization (SP) 26 leading to a high diversity of fluorescence and binding properties, with a corresponding range of biological compatibilities. This review highlights more than seventy fluorogenic aptamer:ligand pairs, the properties of which are collated in Table 1.",
        "TICT-based fluorogenic ligands are extremely sensitive to their local chemical environment and aptamers that control fluorophore conformation have resulted in very bright fluoro-genic systems that are thousands of times brighter than their unbound fluorophore (Fig. 1B). TICT-fluorophores consist of an electron donor (ED) and an electron acceptor moiety (EA) that are linked by a twisted conjugated system that allows for intra-molecular rotation (e.g., methine bridge, overlapping methine or single bond).

Relaxa-tion of this excited TICT state to the ground state then occurs by two main competing processes: fluorescence emission and non-radiative relaxation to the immediate environment.23,24 Ideally, the aptamer bound complex maximizes the process of fluores-cence emission while the unbound state maximizes the yield of nonradiative decay. CQ-based fluorogenic systems covalently link a fluorescent molecule to a high-efficiency short-range quencher. The quencher absorbs energy from the fluorescent fluorophore effectively quenching its fluorescence via nonradiative decay.25 RNA aptamers able to bind either the fluorophore or the quencher physically separate the quencher from the fluoro-phore, allowing it to regain most of its intrinsic fluorescence due to separation of the two moieties (Fig. 1C). SP-based fluorogenic ligands are xanthene-based dyes with fluorescein or rhodamine scaffolds. Here, an intramolecular rearrangement occurs where an equilibrium exists between the open fluorescent quinoid form and the closed non-fluorescent lactone form (Fig. 1D). Based on the polarity of the surrounding environment, this intramolecular equilibrium can shift to favour either the closed or open form.26 Therefore, a change in local environment to favour the open fluorescent form can be achieved upon binding to an RNA aptamer. This review will cover the current selection methods used to identify fluorogenic RNA aptamers, discuss essential photo-physical and biocompatible properties for choosing the optimal tagging system, describe the progression from the early light-up RNA aptamer systems to the current repertoire that is expanding into multi-colour imaging, evaluate their photophysical proper-ties, discuss how specific aptamer qualities meet the require-ments of advanced microscopy applications, and describe their imaging applications to date. General guidelines will be provided for choosing the optimal system from this fluorescent RNA toolbox for specific applications. We end this review with future outlooks that aim to standardize the evaluation of light-up RNA aptamer systems as well as provide perspective for the develop-ment of the next generation of RNA imaging systems.",
        "2. Light-up RNA aptamer selection methods Light-up RNA aptamer systems have been identified through one, or a combination of, in vitro and in vivo methods. Once a target fluorogenic ligand (Fig. 1) has been identified, RNA aptamers against this ligand can be isolated using high diversity (initial RNA populations ranging from 1014–1016 distinct sequences) in vitro selection to screen for aptamers that either have high binding affinity (low KD and low ligand off-rates) or that can rapidly exchange their fluorogenic ligand. Lower diver-sity libraries of aptamers (B106) resulting from such initial screens can then be fed into more novel selection methods that focus on fluorescence-based screening such as microfluidic droplet-based screening or Nonefluorescence-Noneactivated Nonecell Nonesorting (FACS)-based in vivo selection.",
        "2.1 In vitro selection of fluorogenic ligand aptamers In vitro selection (also referred to as Nonesystematic Noneevolution of Noneligands by NoneeNonexponential enrichment or SELEX) is an iterative method used to exponentially enrich for functional nucleic acid subpopulations, in this case RNA, from a high diversity pool population.27–30Initial RNA pools are typically generated by in vitro transcription of a PCR template pool consisting of an uninterrupted randomized sequence element. Typically, each template has a defined 50 and 30 sequence region to allow for reverse transcription, PCR amplifica-tion, and subsequent in vitro transcription in order to regenerate the pool after each round of selection (Fig. 2A). Traditionally, the target ligand is derivatized with a linker to allow for attachment onto a solid phase. RNA pools can then be incubated with the target ligand and washing steps with selective conditions are performed in order to isolate for high affinity binders.29,30 Binding has typically been performed at neutral pH and in high potassium to simulate intracellular conditions.",
        "In a competitive in vitro selection, the RNA pool is first pre-incubated with competitors before incubation with the immo-bilized target ligand to improve target specificity (Fig. 2A). Competitors can include closely related molecules or orthogo-nal ligands intended for generation of multiplex orthogonal light-up RNA systems. Inappropriate binders with slow compe-titor off-rates are unable to rebind to the immobilized target ligand, allowing them to be eliminated by stringent washing steps. To discard fast off-rate aptamers, the free target ligand can also be added to these washes so as to prevent rebinding to immobile support. Target ligand binding aptamers are then recovered from the support and regenerated by RT-PCR fol-lowed by in vitro transcription to undergo another round of selection. After selection, the enriched RNA pools are evaluated based on their phenotypic and genotypic properties. At this step, the aptamer sequence can be truncated31 to isolate the optimal minimal binding motif which can often further improve aptamer performance.32,33 Individual aptamers from the enriched pool are then characterized, by measuring spectral properties, fluorescence enhancement (FE), and binding affinity (dissociation constant, KD). Structural analysis for the most promising candidate(s) can then be used to identify ligand binding modes and serve to initiate the rational design of improved variants.33How the aptamers are recovered from the immobile support plays a key role in the final fluorophore-aptamer binding mode. There are broadly two distinct strategies of elution: denaturing or competitive binding, both having distinct advantages and disadvantages. Denaturing the RNA aptamers to release from the beads has resulted in very high affinity binding interactions (sub-nanomolar)34,35 with very low off-rates for the Mango series of aptamers (Table 1, No. 25–38).34,36 A disadvantage of this approach is that the aptamers can evolve specificity to the linker used to immobilize the ligand to the solid support. Alternatively, addition of free ligand can be used to recover aptamers as was originally performed with the Spinach series of aptamers (Table 1, No. 8–11).32,37,38 This strategy has resulted in micromolar affinity ligand binders with fast exchange ratesChem Soc Rev Review Article4076 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023but relatively poor ligand specificity.39 For more information about these aptamers, see Section 4: ‘‘First generation’’ light-up RNA aptamers.",
        "Most critically, selection for binding affinity does not select for the fluorescence brightness of the ligand-bound RNA species. Therefore, aptamers within the pool must be screened individu-ally for fluorescence after the selection. This procedure can be performed in a high-throughput fashion by screening the output population of an affinity-based selection using fluorescence-activated microfluidics droplet-based screening32,36,40 (Fig. 2B) or FACS-based in vivo cell-based selection41 (Fig. 2C).",
        "2.2 Microfluidics droplet-based screening and FACS-based in vivo selection The high-throughput screening of several millions of molecular variants was revolutionized by microfluidic droplet-based selec-tion protocols originally developed by Tawfik and Griffith.42 The key advantage of this methodology being that genotype is linked to phenotype, as result of both being within the same microscopic droplet. Briefly, and as reviewed in greater depth elsewhere,43 the primary goal is to ensure that a single DNA genome is formed within a small droplet that also contains the reagents required for in vitro transcription and fluorogenic imaging. As droplets can be formed and fused with consider-able precision, the concentration of fluorogenic ligands is precisely known in each droplet. If transcription conditions are also chosen where there is an excess of RNA transcript over the ligand concentration, then the brightest droplets correspond to the aptamers with the highest FE (Fig. 2B). For example, by sorting millions of droplets using a fluorescence droplet sorter, a 4-fold increase in complex brightness for MIII: TO1-B was found relative to that possible using low-throughput manual screening methods when identifying the original MI variant.36 To help ensure the isolation of biologically compa-tible fluorogenic aptamers, the Jaffrey laboratory developed the Broccoli:DFHBI-1T system (Table 1, No. 12) using FACS-based directed evolution.41 A plasmid library containing the low diversity pool and co-expressing the far-red FP (eqFP670) was used as a control for plasmid copy number, which was then transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) (Fig. 2C).

Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4077fluorescence in the low magnesium environment of the cell relative to Spinach and Spinach2 (ref. 41). This two-step approach of first selecting high affinity binders, followed by the selection for high brightness complexes has resulted in bright fluorogenic aptamer systems.34,363. Guidelines for selecting an RNA light-up aptamer system There are multiple factors one must consider when choosing a light-up RNA aptamer system for a specific imaging application. The factors that pertain to both the aptamer and fluorophore components individually and together in complex are highlighted here. These include: the ratio of bound to unbound fluorogenic ligand fluorescence intensity, which is defined as the fluorescent enhancement (FE), aptamer binding affinity (indicated by the dissociation constant, KD), and bound molar fluorescence bright-ness of the fluorogenic ligand (Table 1). In addition to this, we emphasize specific properties that are required for different applications including: single-molecule imaging, super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, two-colour imaging, in vitro diag-nostic detection, and in vitro pull-down assays.",
        "3.1 Photophysical properties A diverse set of light-up RNA aptamer systems have been identified using a wide variety of fluorogenic ligands and isolated using a range of aptamer selection methods. Photo-physical properties of each system are summarized in Table 1. The molar brightness (defined as the product of extinction coefficient multiplied by the quantum yield) of each aptamer-fluorophore complex is dependent on inherent characteristics of both the aptamer and fluorogenic ligand. A high molar fluores-cent brightness is preferable. At this time many fluorogenic aptamer systems are brighter than EGFP which has a brightness of 34 000 MNone1 cmNone1 (ref. 44). Of these two determinant factors, the quantum yield is expected to change significantly more than the extinction coefficient upon formation of the bound ligand state. In addition to fluorophore binding, quantum yield is strongly correlated with the exact binding poise, which defines the local environment and solvent accessibility of the fluorogenic ligand within the aptamer binding pocket. This is illustrated by compar-ing the diverse core motifs within the RNA Mango series that all serve to rigidify its target ligand TO1-B (Fig. 3A). Comparing the crystal structures of Mango (M) I, II, and III.1 variants (Table 1, No. 25, 28 and 33), there is a progression in the bound ligand solvent accessibility as well as increasing co-planarity between the two heterocycles. In MI (Table 1, No. 25), one side of the fluorophore is solvent accessible with a B451 twist between the heterocycles resulting in a quantum yield of 0.14 (ref. 34 and 65). In MII (Table 1, No. 28), one side of the fluorophore is solvent accessible but the heterocycles are now coplanar resulting in a slightly improved quantum yield of 0.21 (ref. 66). Lastly in the MIII.1 variant (Table 1, No. 33), the fluorophore is both solvent inaccessible and lies flat leading to a much more improved quantum yield of 0.66 (ref. 33). As these examples include thesame fluorophore bound by three distinct aptamers, this shows the pivotal role of binding mode in order to achieve a high quantum yield, that together with the extinction coefficient of the bound fluorophore generates a high molar brightness of the bound state.",
        "3.2 Binding affinity (KD), fluorescence enhancement (FE), and fluorescence efficiency (E)Binding affinity (KD). Published RNA light-up aptamers have KD values that range from sub-nanomolar (nM) to sub-millimolar (mM) concentrations (Table 1, ‘‘KD’’ column). KD depends on many variables, pertaining to the architecture of the aptamer binding pocket, that affects the propensity of the fluorogenic ligand to stack and make hydrogen bonds with the nucleic acid bases of its cognate aptamer. KD can be a limiting parameter in applications where the ROI and the fluorogenic ligand are present at low concentrations either in vivo or in vitro. Cell membrane permeability of the fluorogenic ligand can limit the amount of ligand available to bind to the aptamer (see Section 3.5: Biological compatibility for details). As KD ¼ ½Free ligandNoneeq None ½RNA aptamerNoneeq ½RNA aptamer:ligandNoneeq; saturating aptamer bindingwill only occur when the fluorogenic ligand concentration is several multiples of the KD, potentially limiting the sensitivity of RNA detection if such concentrations are not guaranteed.",
        "A majority of published fluorogenic RNA aptamers contain potassium-dependent G-quadruplex (G4) motifs as the core bind-ing motif83 (Table 1, in ‘‘Properties’’ column indicated by ‘G’). G4s are formed by the stacking of two or more G-tetrads that are in turn formed from four guanine bases, that are hydrogen bonded to each other by a 4-fold cyclic permutation of their Hoogsteen and Watson Crick edges.84 With their extensive hydrogen bonding and p–p stacking interactions, these flat motifs form very thermodynamically stable structures upon which fluorogenic ligands can stack. Aside from the recurring theme of G4s in the core aptamer motif, structures immediately peripheral to the binding G4 core typically enhance fluorogenic ligand binding affinity. This trend is reflected in Mango series of aptamers where mutations in such regions were able to disrupt or improve secondary structures resulting in corres-ponding changes in KD. 33,66 Similarly, RNA Spinach serves to rigidify a range of fluorogenic ligands within its core binding motif by sandwiching ligands between a planar G-tetrad and a base triple.85 This theme is not specific to RNA Spinach or Mango aptamers and many fluorogenic aptamers induce fluorescence by stabilizing fluorophores using large nucleic acid planar surfaces such as base quadruples or base-triple motifs within their binding cores33,50,53,65,66,71,72,86 (Fig. 4).",
        "Fluorescence enhancement (FE). Fluorogenicity is quantified by FE, which is the fold change of the fluorescent molar brightness of the bound ligand state divided by the brightness of the unbound ligand state (FE = Fbound/Funbound). Conse-quently, both the high brightness of a bound complex and the dim background fluorescence of an unbound ligand con-tribute to a higher FE. As shown in Table 1, the vast majority ofChem Soc Rev Review Article4078 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023light-up RNA aptamer systems exploit TICT-based fluorogenic mechanisms as aptamer binding cores can be readily selected to stabilize bright planar fluorophore conformations by secondary motifs. Of the current published light-up RNA aptamer systems, the highest FE is of the Pepper:HBC497 system (Table 1, No. 46) achieving a 17 000-fold FE (ref. 35), demonstrating the high fluorogenic potential of the TICT-based fluorophores. In contrast, the FE potential of contact quenching (CQ)-based fluorogenic ligands is highly dependent on the details of the fluorophore ligand design. The design must take into consideration the fluorescent moiety, which should have a high molar brightness in the absence of the quencher, and an optimal linker geometry between the fluorophore and quencher to ensure maximal fluorescence quenching of the ligand in unbound state. These aptamer systems tend to have lower FEcompared to TICT-based fluorogenic ligands as a result (Table 1). Light-up RNA aptamer systems using CQ-based fluorogenic ligands have been identified where the aptamer binds to either the fluorophore or quencher moiety (see Section 5.2: New aptamer systems with multi-colour ligands for details).",
        "Lastly, light-up RNA aptamer systems that utilize spirolacto-nization (SP)-based fluorogenic ligands have been identified. In these systems, fluorogenicity is dependent on the fluorophores intramolecular equilibrium between the ‘‘On’’ and ‘‘Off’’ fluor-escent state which in turn is reliant on the environment.26 The FE of systems with SP-based fluorogenic ligands is typically quite low (Table 1). Binding to the aptamer provides a local environment which stabilizes the ‘‘On’’ state, by mechanisms that have yet to be fully characterized. Further improvements in fluorophore design to skew the equilibrium towards the ‘‘Off’’This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4079state when unbound, as well as understanding of how these aptamers stabilize the ‘‘On’’ state are expected. Fluorescent efficiency (E). The KD and FE together define the fluorescent efficiency (E = FE/KD, nM None1), which describes the contrast between the aptamer bound fluorogenic ligand and the background fluorescence from unbound fluorophore in the presence of minimal fluorophore or aptamer concentrations34 (Fig. 3B). Unless well localized, very low concentrations of RNAper imaged voxel are typically expected.87 Larger values of E indicate that an aptamer:ligand pair is likely to have a higher signal-to-background noise ratio, especially when fluorophore concentrations are only several times higher than KD to ensure saturation of binding to the aptamer tag.",
        "3.3 Determining the thermal stability of fluorogenic RNA aptamers Comparatively, few studies to date have completely decon-volved the effect of temperature on fluorogenic aptamer systems.39 Analysis is complicated by the fact that both the KD and the molar brightness of the bound complex, which is determined by the local environment of the binding core, are temperature dependent. UV (absorbance at 260 nm) and fluorescence melting curves of the Spinach and Mango apta-mers reveal the complexity of such systems.39 When directly comparing the two types of melting curves, the Tm of UV curves is directly related to RNA structure and its melting, but may not be directly correlated to fluorophore binding. Previously published Tm values typically range from 70–80 1C, which is consistent with the high thermal stability of G4 structures.88 These UV-derived Tm values tend to be higher than the melting points derived from fluorescence-based melting curves. The TF value is defined as the temperature at which half maximal fluorescence of the aptamer:ligand complex has been achieved.32,38 Since binding poise may change with tempera-ture, the TF does not directly measure complex melting. There-fore, the data collection method should be considered when comparing the thermal stabilities of different aptamers using Tm versus TF values.",
        "3.4 Photostability, photobleaching, and fluorescent regeneration Photostability is an attractive feature for all imaging applications, allowing for intense illumination conditions, stable signals, and long imaging times. In contrast to FPs, where photobleaching of its internal fluorophore can result in the permanent loss of fluorescence, light-up RNA aptamer systems hold the potential to spontaneously regenerate fluorescence upon photobleaching due to the use of an extrinsic fluorophore, which can be exchanged upon photobleaching.56,67,89,90 Such fluorescent regeneration can considerably extend the photon budget of an fluorogenic aptamer system in ways not possible for conventional FPs or covalently attached fluorophores.",
        "Currently, photobleaching mechanisms and their resulting products are not yet fully understood but photobleaching processes can include photoisomerization,56 oxidation,91 or entry into triplet excited states.92 In one potential pathway, photobleaching can result in the covalent crosslinking of the fluorophore to the aptamer and/or photodamage of the binding pocket resulting in either permanent occupation of the binding pocket or inhibition of binding with a consequent loss of fluorescence. Such effects have unfortunately proven to occur in protein systems.93 More ideally, photobleaching of a fluoro-phore within the binding pocket of the aptamer can result in either a change in the fluorophore conformation or its4080 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023photoinduced degradation, either of which can promote dis-sociation of the photobleached products from the aptamer binding pocket (Fig. 5A). Due to this dependence on fluoro-phore exchange, fluorescent regeneration speed is directly related to the binding kinetics of the unaltered and photo-bleached fluorogenic ligands. Each light-up RNA aptamer system can be considered to be at equilibrium with its unbound and bound states. Upon exposure to light, fluorescent blinking rates will be dictated by an intrinsic on-rate kligand (Fig. 5B). In the event of photobleaching, the conforma-tion and/or structure of the target ligand is now altered. As a result, off-rate for the photobleached product kpotential for the target ligand with a superior KD to competi-tively displace its photobleached counterpart allowing for fluorophore exchange (Fig. 5C). Slow exchange aptamers such as MII (dissociation in hours), intermediate exchange aptamers such as Broccoli and Pepper (dissociation within minutes to hours) and rapid exchange aptamers such as RhoBAST (dissociation on a second timescale) have demonstrated this interesting photoexchange property,35,56,67,77,89 which has many ramifications for continuous and super-resolution imaging dis-cussed later. The Mango systems, with uniquely slow dissocia-tion rates, also enable the downstream pulldown of fluorescent tagged RNA allowing for further characterizations.68,94,953.5 Biological compatibility for in vivo use When using light-up RNA aptamer systems in vivo, one must consider the biological compatibility of the fluorogenic ligand and RNA aptamer as individual components and together as a system (Fig. 6A) for both live-and fixed-cell imaging. First andforemost, the fluorophore must ideally be able to passively diffuse across the cellular membrane into the cell and should not introduce toxicity. Membrane permeability,96 especially for polar or charged ligands with a high molecular weight, as well as cell viability97 should therefore always be tested. Unfortunately, these parameters have not been measured directly for the ligands of fluorogenic RNA aptamers. If diffusion into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cell is possible, it can likely also enter the nucleus via nuclear pores.79 Rigidification of TICT type ligands by bacterial cell walls has been observed during bacterial imaging and background fluorescence can be higher than observed in eukaryotic tissue culture.34,68 In either cell type, entry into the cytoplasm does not guarantee that the fluorophore will form a complex with its RNA aptamer partner. Since the fluorophore is a foreign small molecule, inappropriate compart-mentalization (such as into the lysosome) can occur, sequestering it away from cellular compartments containing RNA. Fluoro-phores with handles of biological origins, such as cobalamin,76 may also lead to inappropriate binding leading to non-specific background fluorescence although biotin modifications to date do not appear to present an issue.67When using genetically encoded aptamers to tag an ROI, the location of the tag insertion site and its specific sequence may alter the RNAs function and/or lifetime (Fig. 6A). Since aptamer sequences are biologically foreign, they must not trigger pre-mature degradation of the tagged ROI nor lead to cell death by perturbing the native function of the RNA. As previously men-tioned, G4s are motifs commonly found within RNA aptamer binding cores (Table 1). The presence of G4s in fluorogenic aptamer tags could also impede RNA functions, such as gene expression and translation.84 Cellular helicases that unwind G4 motifs are known in eukaryotes98 and their effect on the cellular fluorescence of G4-based systems is currently not wellThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4081understood. Despite these caveats, arrays of fluorogenic apta-mers have been successfully inserted into the 30 UTR of mRNAs without perturbing mRNA localization (e.g., dBroccoli and Mango arrays).56,67 RNA and/or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes often require RNA stem-loops to reverse the orientation of an RNA strand within a functional complex. The GNRA tetraloop being a very common way to achieve this in biology. Replacing tetraloops with fluorogenic aptamers that contain a GNRA-like sub-motif is therefore a powerful way to insert a fluoro-genic tag into a functional RNA, that would otherwise be difficult to modify. Both RNA MI and MII for example, contain a GAA^A stem-loop motif-like adapter that isolates their G4-containing ligand binding cores from an external RNA sequence. It has proven possible to tag the essential U1 spliceosomal RNP complex at an isosteric GNRA tetraloop position without loss of biological function94 (Fig. 6B). It appears likely that many other biological RNAs and RNP complex will be able to be fluorogenically tagged without impeding biological function. However, the possible artifacts resulting from tagging should be carefully evaluated. For exam-ple, the insertion of MS2 hairpins may impede the proper degradation of mRNA and result in aberrant mRNA metabolism due to the tight binding of MS2-MCP.99,1004. ‘‘First generation’’ light-up RNA aptamers RNA-based in vitro selection has led to the rapid isolation of the fluorogenic RNA aptamer:ligand systems that are now being tested in a broad range of in vivo and in vitro contexts. Initial selections focused on optimization of basic photophysical properties such as KD, FE, and brightness, allowing for single-colour imaging and detection. These selections identified the importance of biological compatibility and have produced systems that exhibit fluorophore recycling which enable con-tinuous live and fixed cell imaging of RNA. This section focuses on the characterization and utilization of the best characterized fluorogenic RNA aptamer systems to date, before moving onto recently developed second-generation systems, that continue to expand the RNA imaging toolbox. As described previously, the E metric is plotted against wavelength in Fig. 3B in order to evaluate the performance of light-up RNA systems.",
        "4.1 Early fluorogenic aptamers The first fluorogenic RNA aptamers, MG aptamer and SRB aptamers were isolated by Babendure et al. in 2003 using in vitro selection.45 The MG aptamer has a KD of 120 nM, and increases the fluorescence of its ligand by 2400-fold (Table 1, No. 1 and 2).",
        "4082 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023The MG aptamer has also been demonstrated to be able to discriminate between MG and its sulfonated analog.45 Although illumination of MG is likely to introduce cell toxicity due to the generation of free radicals,101 making it unsuitable for cell imaging applications, the high FE of this aptamer opened the possibility of developing biologically compatible fluorogenic systems with high affinity and signal contrast. In 2008, Con-stantin et al. synthesized an asymmetric fluorogenic cyanine dye called dimethylindole red (DIR) and selected the RNA aptamer DIR-Apt1 (Table 1, No. 3), with 86 nM KD using affinity-based in vitro selection.48 Upon binding to DIR-Apt1, DIR ligand fluorescence was shown to enhance by 60-fold. DIR does not intercalate non-specifically into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Suppressing non-specific binding to nucleic acids is important to reduce the background fluorescence and to increase the dynamic range in cell imaging. In the same year, Sando et al. developed a fluorescent blue light-up RNA aptamer tag against the Hoechest 1c ligand (Table 1, No. 7). The transcription of mRNA was monitored in vitro using this system by fusing tandem repeated aptamer tags to the 3’ UTR region of the luciferase dsDNA template.51 In contrast to the earlier identified red light-up RNA aptamers, this blue fluorogenic aptamer expanded the RNA detection toolbox and introduced the possi-bility of multi-colour RNA imaging.",
        "4.2 HBI analogs with the ‘‘veggie soup’’ aptamers: Spinach, Broccoli, and Corn Inspired by the structure of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore p-HBI, Paige et al. (Jaffrey lab) in 2011 synthe-sized a series of fluorogenic HBI analogs and selected RNA binding partners with emission wavelengths spanning the visible spectrum using a competitor binding-based elution in vitro selection.37 Among the RNA-fluorophore complexes, the green fluorescent Spinach-DFHBI (Table 1, No. 8) was found to have the most useful photophysical properties. It was character-ized to have a 540 nM KD and 2000-fold FE. X-ray crystallography of the Spinach-DFHBI complex revealed that RNA Spinach contains a rigid two-layer G4 structure that serves as the binding pocket.53 DFHBI stacks on top of the G4 in a planar conformation via hydrophobic interactions and is further con-formationally restricted by a triple base motif above the ligand and a neighbouring nucleotide. Based on this crystal structure, a minimized version ‘‘Baby Spinach’’ (51-nt) was generated with half the size of its original counterpart while still maintaining comparable fluorescence.52 Although having a well-defined binding pocket, the promiscuous RNA Spinach aptamer does not discriminate between small molecule fluorophores (like TO1-B, ThT, and NMM) and can display even higher FE and E with these ligands.39 Being the first successful study using fluorogenic RNA aptamers in cells, the Spinach-DFHBI system has been demonstrated to be compatible with in vivo imaging for both E. coli bacteria and HEK293T eukaryotic cell imaging of 5S RNA.37 In these applications, high concentrations (tens of micromolar concentration) of the cell permeable DFHBI dye are required due to the low affinity binding of the Spinach aptamer.",
        "To improve the thermal stability and folding of RNA Spinach in live cells, Strack et al. developed Spinach2 (Table 1, No. 10) by systematic mutational analysis and addressing mismatches within the stem regions found in the original Spinach.38 Compared to Spinach with 32% and 13% folding at 25 1C and 37 1C respectively, Spinach2 (TF = 38 1C) exhibited better folding with 58% and 37% at the same temperatures respec-tively. This improvement resulted in 3-fold brighter fluores-cence for Spinach2 than Spinach in live HEK293T cell imaging. Besides live-cell imaging, an engineered variant called iSpinach (Table 1, No. 11) had been reported by Autour et al. (Ryckelynck lab) for in vitro applications with still higher brightness and thermal stability.32,55 Based on the scaffold of Spinach1.1, which is a parental variant of Spinach 2, a library was generated via error-prone PCR and screened via microfluidic-assisted in vitro selection. Through further miniaturization and engineering, iSpinach was obtained. It is less salt-sensitive and more thermal-stable (TF = 44 1C in presence of potassium ion, TF = 36 1C in presence of sodium ion) than Spinach2, which is more suitable for in vitro transcription conditions. Compared to Spinach2, iSpinach had been demonstrated as a superior RNA concentration indicator to monitor the RNA transcription and iXm1 ribozyme activity in 37 1C potassium-free environment.32Another green member of the RNA ‘‘vegetable’’ aptamers is Broccoli (Table 1, No. 12), which binds to an improved DFHBI analog (DFHBI-1T),102 developed by Filonov et al. (Jaffrey lab) in 2014 (ref. 41). To optimize the RNA aptamer for use in live cells, the RNA library after in vitro selection was cloned into E. coli bacteria then screened using a FACS-based in vivo selection method. The cell-based screening solved the RNA aptamer misfolding issue present in Spinach and Spinach2 in vivo and resulted in the identification of Broccoli with higher thermal stability (TF = 48 1C) and lower dependence of magnesium for fluorescence than Spinach2.",
        "A yellow fluorogenic RNA Corn aptamer had been reported by Song et al. (Jaffrey lab) in 2017 (ref. 57). Compared to DFHBI, the fluorophore ligand DFHO mimics the chromophore of red fluorescent protein (RFP). It contains an elongated p-conjugated system via addition of an acylimine substituent at the C2 position of the imidazoline ring. The Corn:DFHO (Table 1, No. 14) complex exhibits improved photostability in live HEK293T cell imaging compared to Broccoli:DFHBI. One possible explanation for this behaviour being that the photo-bleached product dissociates from Corn allowing a fresh DFHO ligand to bind. Because of its increased photostability, Corn:DFHO system has been utilized for quantitative monitoring of cellular Pol III promoter activity in live HEK293T cells.57 Within the same study, the authors demonstrated that DFHO can also bind to the parental aptamer of Broccoli with more red-shifted emission wavelength (lex = 515 nm, lem = 575 nm) than Corn:DFHO complex (lex = 505 nm, lem = 545 nm). Directed evolution of Broccoli precursor templates resulted in identifi-cation of Orange Broccoli (Table 1, No. 16) and Red Broccoli (Table 1, No. 17). However, the improved photostability of Corn was not preserved in these Broccoli variants, indicating that DFHO is not intrinsically stable, and implies that photostabilityReview Article Chem Soc RevThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4083is possibly determined by differing ligand recycling kinetics of these aptamer:ligand complexes. The crystal structure of Corn: DFHO complex reveals an unusual binding mode, with the G4 cores from each of two Corn RNA molecules forming a homo-dimer interface to sandwich one DFHO ligand without any intermolecular base pairs.58 This homodimerization of RNA Corn suggests the potential to design fluorogenic tools for monitoring RNA–RNA interactions. Recently, the RNA Corn aptamer was used to engineer a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosensor for both in vitro and in vivo sensing.103 Kim and co-workers fused the Corn aptamer via a transducer module into the SAM riboswitch aptamer.104 The binding of SAM to the SAM aptamer induces Corn aptamer folding, and consequent dimerization, resulting in a 10-fold fluorescence activation over the SAM minus state. This design demonstrates the potential for increasingly sophisticated genetically encodable RNA-based fluorescent sensors able to detect a broad range of metabolites.",
        "4.3 TO1 analogs with the Mango ‘‘fruit’’ series of aptamers Over the past 30 years, a well-studied unsymmetrical cyanine fluorogenic dye: thiazole orange (TO) has been used broadly as a nucleic acid stain through double-strand intercalation.105 TO consists of a benzothiazole ring and a quinoline ring which are connected via a rotational bridging methine. It gained great interest as a biomolecule for fluorescence sensing, owing to its low background signal and remarkable fluorescence activation upon conformational lock of the rotational methine bond. In 2014, Dolgosheina et al. (Unrau lab) selected the green fluoro-genic RNA MI aptamer against the cell permeable TO1-B with 3.2 nM KD and 1100-fold FE (ref. 34) (Table 1, No. 25). An acetate modification at the N-position of benzothiazole was used, which enables further generation of an amide bond to desta-bilize double-strand intercalation as previously described.106 The unprecedented KD of the MI:TO1-B complex enabled the single-molecule RNA imaging in vitro by TIRF.34 MI also exhi-bits excellent ligand discrimination and does not bind to the Spinach ligand DFHBI.39 The crystal co-structure of MI complex reveals a GAA^A-tetraloop adaptor that connects a closing stem region to a three-tiered G4 binding core.65 The first generation MI:TO1-B complex exhibits a modest quantum yield of 0.14 suggesting room for improvement. The two heterocycles of TO1 are at a 451 degree to each other, suggesting that further improvement of quantum yield could be achieved by minimizing this binding angle.65 This was achieved by microfluidic droplet-based fluorescent selection, where new Mango aptamers 4-fold brighter were isolated.33,66,71 These well-characterized aptamers all contain G4 binding cores and have similar thermal stability (with TF range 40–45 1C), are stabilized strongly by potassium ions and to a lesser extent sodium, while having unique structures that all bind to TO1-B in a substantially planar form. MII shows sub-nanomolar affinity to TO1-B (Table 1, No. 28), and like MI, has a GAA^A tetraloop-like adaptor and a three-tiered G4, where the T3 layer proximal to the TO1 ligand contains four adenine-containing propeller loops,66 flattening the G4 surface and leaving the top of the bound complex opento solvent, perhaps explaining its modest quantum yield of 0.21. Interestingly, both MI and MII are highly resistant to formaldehyde, enabling fixed cell imaging. Incubation with formaldehyde does not interfere with TO1-B binding, even though the top adenine-containing loops with exposed second-ary amines are chemically modified. Crystal structures indicate that the stacked G-tetrad planes are highly impermeable to solvent, demonstrating its importance in fluorophore binding.",
        "MIII (Table 1, No. 30–32) displays the brightest fluorescence with an improved quantum yield of 0.56. MIII consists of a two-tiered G4 that sandwiches the TO1-B ligand between a trans base pair. This shielding from solvent, in addition to the planar binding of the TO1-B ligand, may potentially explain the high quantum yield of this system. The crystal structure of MIII reveals that its G4 stacks onto a base triplet that in turn stacks onto the top of a closing helix,33 suggesting that this aptamer rigidly connects its fluorogenic ligand to its external stems. This has been validated by orientation-dependant FRET experiments which make use of the similarly rigid Broccoli aptamer.69 Structure-guided engineering identified an enhanced variant called MIII.1 (Table 1, No. 33–35, previously named MIIIA10U)33 with an improved quantum yield of 0.66 and higher KD (1.5 nM). 70 Structure-guided reselection of MIII resulted in a variant called iMangoIII (iMIII) (Table 1, No. 36) which exhibits an improved FE and quantum yield compared to the MIII wild type.70 However, the reselection failed to identify variants brighter than MIII.I, which suggested that the trans U10NoneU17 base pair stacking on top of TO1-B is optimal for fluorescence brightness.70MIV (Table 1, No. 37 and 38), which behaves as the brightest variant in fixed cell imaging,71 was determined to be a domain-swapped homodimer in crystallography studies.71 Unlike the Corn:DFHO pair with a 2 : 1 stoichiometric binding ratio,58 MIV binds to TO1-B with a 1 : 1 ratio and the homodimer is linked via a intermolecular helix formed by a palindromic sequence. The intermolecular helix is formed by the first six nucleotides, and the three-tiered G4 binding cores stack coaxially on the ends of the helix without junction connecting the G4 and helix.71RNA Mango imaging applications of note include the use of the Mango series (II to IV) for imaging the cellular localization of small non-coding RNA.36 In addition to this, MII has been used in various mammalian cell imaging applications including single-molecule tracking of mRNA in live cells alongside the MS2 system demonstrating 2-colour imaging, single-molecule RNA FISH, as well as super-resolution imaging.67 These applications will be discussed in more detail in Section 7.2–7.4.",
        "5. ‘‘Second generation’’ light-up RNA aptamers Over the last 5 years, many new classes of fluorogenic RNA aptamer-ligand systems have been reported.

        "5.1 Pairs of aptamer systems with binding and spectral orthogonality The lack of discrimination between specific ligands has delayed the development of orthogonal aptamer-ligand pair systems for multi-colour imaging. As most of the light-up RNA aptamers consist of a G4 binding pocket, this can lead to the promiscuous binding of ligands. There is a demand in the field to engineer orthogonal aptamer systems that can enable simultaneous two-colour imaging. Mango and Peach orthogonal pair. Kong et al. (Unrau lab) selected RNA Peach aptamers (Table 1, No. 39–44) against TO3-B through a competitive denaturing in vitro selection.70 Using unbiotinylated TO1 analogs as the orthogonal competitors in the selection, aptamers able to preferentially bind to TO3-B rather than TO1-B were selected. Compared to the TO1-B specific binder RNA MIII.1 variant (Table 1, No. 33), the selected Peach I (P1) aptamer is 8.3-fold more fluorescently efficient towards TO3-B (Table 1, No. 40) and 270-fold less efficient towards TO1-B (Table 1, No. 39) than MIII.1 (Fig. 3C, blue oval). The binding and spectral orthogonality of Mango and Peach pairs enabled the in vitro quantification of two RNA concentrations simultaneously for concentrations of RNA ranging from 0 to 50 nM, and holds promise for two-colour RNA imaging in vivo. Squash-Broccoli orthogonal pair. Another attempt of engi-neering binding orthogonal pair for dual-colour RNA labelling and imaging is based on the light-up RNA aptamers that activate HBI analogs. In 2021, Dey et al. (Jaffrey lab) evolved RNA Squash, which binds to both DFHBI-1T and DFHO, from the bacterial adenine riboswitch60 (Table 1, No. 18 and 19). They repurposed the parental adenosine riboswitch scaffold61 by randomizing the sequence and length within the adenine-binding pocket. The crystal structures of the RNA Squash: ligand complexes indicate that, instead of harboring a G4, Squash forms a three-way junction to encapsulate it in a largely hydrophobic binding pocket that reduces its solvent accessi-bility and promote RNA:ligand contacts.61 This redesigning of an existing high affinity riboswitch potentially expands the orthogonal toolbox by introducing a novel binding structure. In comparison with Broccoli (Table 1, No. 12), Squash displays a 4.9-fold higher KD towards DFHO (Table 1, No. 19) and 12-fold lower KD to BI (a DFHBI analog). 60 Using this property of selective binding, Dey et al. also demonstrated the combined use of Broccoli:BI and Squash:DFHO as an orthogonal pair of fluorogenic RNA aptamer tags for dual-colour in live-cell imaging.60 Further key photophysical properties of this pair, like molar brightness and FE need to be provided for objective evaluation and comparison with other systems. Corn and Beetroot orthogonal pair. Recently, Wu et al. selected and characterized a red fluorogenic RNA aptamer call RNA Beetroot (Table 1, No. 20 and 21), which can selectively bind a HBI analog: DFAME with a large Stokes shift (lex = 514 nm,lem = 619 nm). 59 Beetroot and Corn pair exhibited orthogonality from the aspects of both KD and FE (Fig. 3C). Using E as a metric, Beetroot is 45-fold more fluorescently efficient than Corn when binding to DFAME (Table 1, No. 20 vs. 15), and Corn is 450-fold more efficient than Beetroot towards DFHO (Table 1, No. 14 vs. 21). Since Beetroot and Corn both form a homodimer, they have been used as tandem repeat tags in live-cell imaging to induce macromolecular assembly via multivalent intermolecular interaction.59 Together with fluorescent proteins, the authors also achieved orthogonal multi-colour imaging of RNA–protein assemblies in HEK293T cells simultaneously.",
        "5.2 Aptamer systems with multi-colour ligands The use of RNA aptamers offers the potential to change the spectral properties of the ligand via chemical modifications to the fluorophore, which do not interfere with binding. Such systems allow the facile switching of spectral properties of the RNA tag simply by changing the fluorogenic ligand. For exam-ple, a MI-tagged 6S RNA construct, normally used with the green TO1-B can be used with the closely related red TO3-B (Fig. 3A and Table 1, No. 25 and 26). It enables two-colour fluorescence cross-correlation measurements with a green GFP-tagged RNA polymerase complex, which fluoresces in the TO1-B colour channel.94 This fluorophore spectral shifting approach enables the rapid optimization of RNA tags for multi-colour imaging with existing FP protein tags.",
        "DIR-Pro and OTB-SO3. Using DIR as the target ligand, in 2017, Tan et al. selected a second generation RNA aptamer named DIR2s-Apt49 (Table 1, No. 4–6). This aptamer has demonstrated binding specificity towards DIR, but not to MG. Interestingly, DIR2s-Apt displays binding promiscuity to multi-ple unsymmetrical cyanine dyes, including the red DIR analogs and derivatives of blue fluorophore OTB. Among the cyanine dyes, DIR2s-Apt shows the highest affinity to DIR-Pro (310 nM) and 45-fold FE, whereas it had the largest FE towards OTB-SO3 (70-fold activation) and 740 nM KD. Since the excitation and emission spectra of bound DIR-Pro (lex = 600 nm, lem = 658 nm) and OTB-SO3 (lex = 380 nm, lem = 421 nm) are completely orthogonal, DIR2s-Apt had been used for dual-colour live-cell imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with either red or blue fluorophores. Crystal structures of DIR2s-Apt:OTB-SO3 complex revealed that the aptamer does not contain a G4 binding motif like the previously reported fluorogenic systems,65 which is consistent with the observation that folding is independent to the presence of monovalent cations but dependant on divalent cation concentrations (such as magnesium).49 The binding site adopts a tuning fork-like architecture consisting of two stem-loop, and the loop-loop interactions provides a stacking platform for ligand binding. In addition to the stacking platform, there is only one unpaired adenosine residue that caps the top of the ligand, the promis-cuity of DIR2s-Apt can be explained by the lack of a tight binding pocket and specific intermolecular interactions. Despite the fact that sequential dual-colour imaging had been achieved by using DIR2s-Apt in living A431 mammalian cells, two-colour channel detection cannot be achieved simultaneously and has to beReview Article Chem Soc RevThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4085stained by using either DIR-Pro or OTB-SO3 sequentially since there is a lack of specificity between the aptamer and ligand. The unique binding structure of DIR2s-Apt might introduce a new prospect of structural-guided engineering of fluorogenic RNA aptamer without G4s, which holds the potential to be further engineered as an orthogonal pair with G4-containing fluorogenic systems such as Spinach, Broccoli, and Mango. Chili system. Based on the HBI chromophore and Spinach system scaffold, Steinmetzger et al. (Höbartner lab) performed structural-guided engineering based on the 13-2 aptamer tem-plate (a variant of Spinach) and identified an aptamer named Chili (Table 1, No. 22–24) which can enhance fluorescence of DMHBI.62 Steinmetzger et al. performed extensive modifica-tions of the ligand in order to create a series of HBI derivatives with large Stokes shifts having yellow to red fluorescence emissions.62,63 Instead of a reselection of the RNA aptamer, 36 HBI fluorophores were screened against RNA Chili aptamer. A set of ligands with an aryl substituent at the N3 position of the imidazoline ring exhibits the brightest fluorescence upon binding to Chili. The best representative with the highest quantum yield of 0.40 was DMHBI+, which exhibited a yellow fluorescent emission and can bind to Chili with 63 nM affinity (Table 1, No. 23). In addition to this, an orange-fluorescent species DMHBO+ displayed the highest affinity towards Chili with 12 nM (Table 1, No. 24). Co-crystal structures of the Chili:ligands complexes suggested that Chili adopts a two-tiered G4 binding pocket.64 DMHBO+ and DMHBI+ show a twisted conformation when bound to Chili, similar to the chromophore structures of long Stokes shift fluorescence pro-tein (e.g., LSSmKate107 and mCRISPred108). The large Stokes shift of this system was explained through excited state proton transfer (ESPT), which describes how the fluorogen undergoes electron rearrangement and energy transfers upon excitation.109 The speculation of ESPT mechanism is supported by structure and time-resolved spectroscopy. Although the applications of Chili and its multi-colour ligands remains to be explored, this study intro-duced new methods of optimization of fluorogenic aptamers by fine-tuning the chromophores via chemical modifications. Pepper system. Also inspired by the work of RNA mimics of GFP,37 in 2019 Chen et al. (Yang lab) designed a GFP chromophore-like synthetic dye (HBC) and selected a fluorogenic RNA aptamer called Pepper35 (Table 1, No. 45–52). Pepper binds to HBC with excellent photophysical properties, including bright green fluorescence, nanomolar KD (3.5 nM), high melting tem-perature (TF B 55 1C), fast association (0.66 None 106 MNone1 sNone1) and slow dissociation rate (0.0023 sNone1). To expand the fluorescence spectral range of Pepper:HBC system, a series of HBC analogs with emission from cyan to red had been synthesized by tuning the electron effects of the p-conjugation system. The HBC analogs all exhibited nanomolar KD and had been used in live 293T/17 cell multi-colour imaging of RNA. The crystal structures of Pepper with each HBC analog show a lack of a G4, instead, Pepper has a double helical tuning-fork-like architecture within its binding pocket that tolerates the modifications of HBC.72 Due to the multi-colour options, high affinity and brightness of this system, Pepper had been employed in various cell imagingapplications. For example, imaging of genomic loci using CRISPR display of Pepper,35 Pepper-dependent regulation of protein stabilization,110 and use as a genetically encoded fluor-escent RNA indicator for monitoring RNA translocation and degradation in live HEK293T cells.1115.3 CQ-based multi-colour fluorogenic aptamers. Another strategy to develop a fluorogenic RNA aptamer is based on a molecular beacon-like mechanism. Instead of binding a specific fluorogenic ligand, the RNA aptamer was selected to bind the contact-quencher conjugated to the fluorogen. In 2015, Arora et al. first reported a RNA aptamer called DNB which to binds to a general dinitroaniline (DN) fluorescence quencher73 (Table 1, No. 53–57). Upon binding of DN to DNB, the fluores-cence of various contact-quenched rhodamine dye-DN conju-gates can be turned on, which provides a versatile platform for changing the spectral properties of the aptamer system. The best conjugates for DNB aptamer system were found to be the yellow TMR-DN (Table 1, No. 55) and yellow SR-DN (Table 1, No. 56) with 350 nM and 800 nM KD, 9.3-and 38-fold FE respectively. With the combined use of the quencher binding DNB aptamer and a fluorogen binding SRB-2 aptamer,28 orthogonal binding and dual-colour imaging has been achieved in E. coli bacteria.",
        "Using the same RNA aptamer:quencher binding strategy, in 2018, Braselmann et al. (Palmer lab) utilized the specific high affinity binding of an E. coli cobalamin (CbI, B12) riboswitch112 to its natural CbI ligand and engineered the multi-colour Riboglow platform76 (Table 1, No. 64–65). In this system, the efficient quencher CbI is conjugated with various commercially available fluorophore, including FAM, ATTO series and Cy5. By engineering the quencher-fluorophore linker and mutating the RNA riboswitches, the best pair exhibits 34 nM KD and B5-fold FE (Table 1, No. 65). This Riboglow system has also been used for multi-colour mRNA imaging of stress granules.76 However, the quencher-fluorophore conjugate probe is not cell perme-able and needs to be introduced into cells via mechanical methods (e.g., bead loading).",
        "In contrast to developing fluorescence quencher binding RNA aptamers, RhoBAST is a TMR-DN fluorogen binding RNA aptamer that binds to TMR (Table 1, No. 66), which had been reported by Sunbul et al. (Jäschke lab) in 2021 (ref. 77). RhoBAST exhibits excellent brightness (55 000 MNone1 cmNone1), 26-fold FE and 15 nM KD. The aptamer is thermostable with a Tm of 79 1C. Since RhoBAST also displays remarkable photostability and fast ligand exchange kinetics (ksee Fig. 5B), the blinking properties of this system has been used for super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging of RNA in live HEK293T and HeLa cells as will be discussed subsequently.",
        "A new strategy based on contact quenching mechanism is to design the fluorogenic probe which can be self-quenched by dimerization. In 2020, Bouhedda et al. (Ryckelynck lab) selected the RNA aptamer o-Coral which can turn on the fluorescence of a quenched dimerized SRB-derived fluorogen called Gemini-561 (ref. 79) (Table 1, No. 68). Upon binding to o-Coral (KD = 73 nM),Chem Soc Rev Review Article4086 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023the fluorescence of Gemini-561 increases 13-fold. Recent rational design of the Gemini (called G552alk-C) further improved E with higher KD (7.5 nM) and larger FE (110-fold) 113 (Table 1, No. 69). Despite the large size of the dimerized ligand which potentially could result in poor cell permeability, the Gemini ligand can be introduced into live HEK293T cells successfully with only a 5 min incubation.113 This concept of engineering dimerization-based fluorogenic module provides new guides of engineering ultrabright fluorogenic aptamer-ligand system and is promising for the development of heterodimerization modules. Recently, an avidity-based dimeric aptamer named biRhoBAST78 (Table 1, No. 67) has been reported that it binds towards a fluorogenic bivalent fluorophore TMR2 with KD = 40 pM. Compared to its monomer form (RhoBAST), biRhoBAST exhibits B23 000-fold improved binding affinity. This avidity concept introduces a new versatile strategy which enables engineer tight binding systems using dimerization of previous RNA aptamers.",
        "5.4 SP-based aptamer systems The new concept of fluorogenicity based on the mechanism of spirocyclization has recently been introduced into the field of light-up RNA aptamers. In 2019, Wirth et al. (Jäschke lab) presented a near-infrared RNA aptamer named SiRA which can bind and increase the fluorescence of a spirolactonized silicon-rhodamine dye by shifting the open-closed equilibrium towards the open fluorescent state81 (Table 1, No. 70). The cell perme-ability of this fluorophore, its high brightness and photostability are features of this fluorogenic system. The best characterized pair: SiRA*2 complex, with a TF of 47 1C, shows a remarkable quantum yield of 0.98 in its bound form and has been used in super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) micro-scopy imaging of mRNA in E. coli bacteria (see Section 7.4: Super-resolution imaging of RNA for details). The relative weak binding (KD = 430 nM) and low FE (7-fold) may limit its sensitivity in certain applications. Selection of aptamers against some recent spirorhodamine dyes,26,114 whose equilibrium favours the closed non-fluorescent state, could further improve the fluorescent efficiency of such systems in the future. Using a similar strategy, in 2021, Zhang et al. engineered a colour-shifting fluorogenic RNA aptamer module: BeCA-BC82 (Table 1, No. 71). The closed form of BC fluorogen is a cyan fluorescent species which switches into an open form with near-infrared fluorescence upon binding to BeCA RNA aptamer. BeCA was characterized to binds to the BC6 ligand with a KD of 220 nM and exhibits a 15-fold ratiometric change (cyan/NIR emission ratio change). Although this system still faces the issue of relatively low dynamic range of FE, the colour-shifting module successfully expands the toolbox of fluorescent RNA live-cell imaging and is promising to be used for site-specific RNA labelling in situ.",
        "6. In vitro applications A key advantage of fluorogenic aptamers is that fluorescence signal is effectively created by the transcription of the RNAaptamer allowing the detection of RNAs as they are produced, with fluorescence proportional to the amount of RNA. For aptamers with slow off-rates, purification of tagged RNAs is also enabled. By using pairs of fluorogenic aptamers, two-colour reporters can be generated with numerous applications. In this section we, for reasons of space, none exhaustively review some of the many applications of fluorogenic aptamers.",
        "6.1 Transcriptional reporter assays By tagging DNA with a fluorogenic aptamer, in vitro and in vivo transcriptional reporter assays have proven particularly simple to implement as the act of transcription results in an RNA product that can be detected by addition of the fluorogenic ligand (Fig. 7A). Fluorogenic aptamers have been used to detect a broad range of transcriptional activities in vitro that range from lucifer-ase transcription monitoring51 using blue fluorescent RNA (Table 1, No. 7), iXm ribozyme activity detection32 using iSpinach (Table 1, No. 11) to steroid induction of mRNA via MII (Table 1, No. 25).115 These examples suggest that the fluorogenic tag fusion method can be used for precise quantification of ROI, and its sensitivity is comparable to traditional methods like non-specific RNA dye staining and RT-PCR. More importantly, it features site-specific labelling and real-time monitoring in native biological contexts, which broadens in vivo applications with higher complexity. In the cell, Corn and Pepper systems have been used to report on RNA function and metabolism by monitoring the suppression of polymerase III transcription, the spatial translocation of ribonucleic anti-terminator (RAT) RNA element and RNA degradation caused by barnase nuclease activation.57,111 By incorporating fluorogenic aptamers into ROI, this allows for a wide variety of assays that measure transcrip-tional activities both temporally and spatially.",
        "6.2 RNP complex purification Certain classes of fluorogenic RNA aptamers may prove to have a significant advantage over existing purification methods116 for the recovery of high purity native RNP complexes. While the development of high-throughput formaldehyde and UV cross-linking methods have uncovered many RNA-binding proteins and miRNA–protein complexes, the covalent modifications that occur in these methods preclude downstream biochemical studies. High purity native complexes are required in many applications that include the detailed biochemical and structural characterization of RNP complexes and screening for inhibition of complex function via the use of small molecule libraries. In addition to RNA imaging, ROI-tagged fluorogenic aptamers that have slow off-rates for their fluorogenic ligands offer the potential for RNA–protein complex pulldowns (Table 1, pull-down in ‘‘Properties’’ column indicated by ‘P’). Selections using competitive binding strategies and long washing steps have resulted in very slow off-rates (characteristic times of half a day), which enable applications including tagged RNA pulldown, RNP purification, and gel shift experiments.",
        "Using CRISPR gene modification technology,117 biologically compatible slow off-rate fluorogenic aptamers can be geneti-cally encoded into endogenous ROI to allow for the purificationReview Article Chem Soc RevThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4087of high purity native RNP complexes using simple purification protocols.68 The insertion of a fluorogenic tag first allows the spatial and temporal dynamics of the RNP complex to be visualized in either fixed or living cells. Then, and as discussed in Section 2 of this review, nearly all fluorogenic aptamers have been selected by immobilizing the fluorogenic ligand onto a solid support using a biotin tag through a flexible linker. Chan-ging this biotin conjugated to the fluorophore to desthiobiotin provides a pulldown method by affinity-based elution (Fig. 7B). This method is directly competitive with other aptamer-basedRNP purification methods such as the native streptavidin binding S1 aptamer recovery protocol.118 An additional benefit to the use of fluorogenic aptamers is that the recovered RNP complex still contains the bound fluorophore. This allows for the fluorescent visualization of the complex through gel shift experiments and further purification by size exclusion chromatography.",
        "The MI and MIII aptamers have been used to demonstrate such approaches in bacteria.68,94 Recently, the 6S RNA was CRISPR-tagged with MIII and used to image 6S accumulation in stationary phase. Tagged 6S complexes were then purified4088 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023from bacteria as a function of growth condition and the product RNAs formed in the 6S:RNAP complex were characterized.68 Previously, a MI-tagged plasmid expressing 6S RNA was used to rapidly obtain high purity 6S:RNAP complex by a pull down, size exclusion purification scheme. Mass spectrometry analysis of the recovered bacterial RNA polymerase found it to be as pure as NEB holoenzyme.94 Low off-rates also enable rapid native PAGE RNP gel shift methods as staining of the RNP with free fluorogenic ligand is not typically required.119,1206.3 Isothermal amplification reporter assays. The recent COVID19 pandemic has pointed out the difficulty of detecting nucleic acids at the attomolar concentration (Bone template molecule per microlitre), which is the practical limit of detection of viral RNAs in saliva. This remains a difficult problem that has been practically solved to date by a range of amplification methods. RT-PCR is the dominant technology in this area, but requires a device capable of thermocycling in non-laboratory settings. Isothermal methods able to amplify very low concentrations of RNA are fortunately fully compatible with the use of fluorogenic aptamers as transcriptional RNA reporters. This results in a significantly simpler design for the in vitro detection of nucleic acids. For example, NASBA (Nonenucleic Noneacid Nonesequence-Nonebased Noneamplification) can amplify RNA with great specificity in a one pot reaction by addition of two DNA primers (primer A and B) and a three-enzyme mix. First, reverse tran-scriptase (RT) makes an RNA:DNA heteroduplex, by addition of primer A encoding a T7 promoter. This step is followed by RNA degradation, using RNaseH, to allow top strand primer B (encoding the fluorogenic aptamer tag) to anneal and be extended by RT into a duplex DNA that can now be transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. The exponentially enriched RNA, can then be quantified by fluorescence read-out of the aptamer allowing for picomolar detection sensitivities with multichan-nel capabilities121 (Fig. 7C). By performing a nested isothermal reaction, attomolar sensitivities were simple to obtain.122 As such reagents are easily lyophilized, portable detection kits are likely to be developed commercially. Such methods appear to be competitive with other isothermal technologies such as Sherlock.1236.4 Logical toggle switches The creation of fluorescence by transcription is a potent strength of fluorogenic aptamer systems. Here we focus on two specific examples that can formally be classified as logical gates; where two polymer inputs are ’processed’ to provide a two-state fluor-escent readout signal. While still in their infancy, it is easy to imagine how such circuits could be expressed in living cells in the future. Fig. 7D show a logical ‘AND’ gate. By splitting the Broccoli aptamer into two parts, fluorescence is only obtained if both top and bottom strands are expressed allowing the formation of the fluorescent complex.124 To utilize the Broccoli RNA aptamer to detect and visualize RNA–RNA interactions, a split version called ‘‘Split-Broccoli’’ has been designed by Alam et al.124 The assembly of the ‘‘top’’ and ‘‘bottom’’ strands reconstitutes the Broccoli by increasing the fluorescence 186-fold in vitro. Using this system,mCherry expression level in E. coli has been regulated together with a use of toehold switch containing the top strand at the 5’ end of the open reading frame (ORF). Upon binding of the bottom strand to the top strand, the ribosomal binding site (RBS) sequestered by the toehold switch is exposed and activated for downstream translation.124This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4089(ref. 127). FRET, however, is intrinsically very sensitive to changes in angular orientation in instances where the FRET donor and acceptor are rigidly connected to the biomolecule under investigation.128 These two aspects of FRET make it of high relevance to RNA sensor design and for cellular reporters as RNA structures with multiple conformational states often induce changes in helical stacking angles. The development of orthogonal fluorogenic aptamers promises to not only enable the use of RNA–RNA FRET within living cells, but also the detection of angular changes in RNA complexes. Mango–Spinach FRET pairs. In 2018, Jepsen et al. developed aptamer-dependent FRET (apta-FRET).54 It has been demonstrated in a range of artificial RNA structures where RNA–RNA FRET measurements were performed using MI:YO3-Biotin (Table 1, No. 27) as a FRET acceptor and Spinach:DFHBI-1T as a FRET donor54 (Fig. 8A). In addition to the spectral overlap between the two fluorogenic ligands (Fig. 8Aii), MI can specifically bind to TO-based ligands while rejecting the DFHBI-1T ligand.39 Due to differences in KD between MI and Spinach for their target ligand (26 nM versus 340 nM respectively, Table 1, No. 9 and 27), low concentrations of YO3-B were used to saturate the MI binding pocket meanwhile leaving the Spinach binding pocket available to be saturated with much higher concentrations of DFHBI-1T (ref. 54). By optimizing the spacer length between the two, the maximum FRET value was reported to be B0.6 (ref. 54). Since the GAA^A tetraloop-like adaptor of MI is conformationally flexible,65 the FRET acceptor is rotationally averaged in these experiments (Fig. 9A–C). This renders the system similar to conventional distance-dependent FRET where synthesized chromophores are typically chemically attached to targets of interest via floppy linker motifs. This FRET system was used in conjunction with a SAM riboswitch to detect SAM concentrations in vitro, with a KD of 17 micromolar for SAM. 54 More recently, by removing the palindromic sequence found in homodimer interface of MIV, a heterodimer-based FRET pair had been designed that combines the iSpinach:DFHBI-1T and MIV:YO3-B pairs71 into a FRET system. An application for this heterodimer complex remains to be demonstrated. Mango–Broccoli orientation-dependent FRET pairs. Orientation-dependent FRET enables the study of bimolecular interactions with the advantage of focusing on angular conformational changes. For example, conformational changes in the spliceo-some are understood from cryo-EM studies to involve helical motions,129,130 that could be studied with orientation-dependent FRET. Likewise, protein synthesis involves angular oscillations between the large and small ribosomal subunits131 which has been previously studied with distance-dependant FRET132 but could be more precisely monitored by orientation-dependant FRET. Oriented FRET has traditionally been very difficult to achieve, but has been enabled in vitro by the development of rigid fluorogenic aptamers. RNA MIII stacks its fluorogenic G4-based binding domain on top of a base triple which in turn stacks on top of a closing RNA helix33 (Fig. 9D–F). This rigidly connects the fluorogenic ligands of MIII to an arbitrary RNA helix allowing it to communicate the angular orientation of this helix fluorescently. Similarly, RNA Broccolirigidly connects its fluorogenic binding pocket to helixes above and below the pocket which also allows this fluorogenic aptamer to report angular orientation. MIII binds to YO3-B with much higher affinity than Broccoli (11 nM versus 910 nM),69 allowing for a similar methodology as described previously where low concentrations of YO3-B and high concentrations of DFHBI-1T were used (ref. 54 and 69) (Table 1, No. 12 and 32). Using this rigid apta-FRET system, with DFHBI-1T as the FRET donor and YO3-B as the FRET acceptor, the spectral overlap enabled angular-dependent FRET measurements for a range of helical lengths between the acceptor and donor (Fig. 8Bi). As crystal structures suggest, both the acceptor dipole and donor dipoles are nearly perpendicular to their helical stems in an initial construct where a helical duplex rigidly connects the two aptamers.69 By extension, and consequently rotation, of this connecting duplex, regular oscillations in FRET efficiency (ERigid fluorogenic aptamers could also be used to monitor the folding of the nickel/cobalt riboswitch, where two stem loops within the structure become parallel upon binding of either metal ion133 (Fig. 8Biv, v). By systematically varying the insertion location of each aptamer, sets of orientation-dependent FRET measurements could be collected.69 Such FRET measurements are compatible with the design of cell-based sensors, but eukar-yotic cell-based oriented-FRET designs have yet to be reported.",
        "7.2 Two-colour RNA sensors and RNA–protein imaging Due to the intrinsic difficulty in interpreting the meaning of a single channel fluorescence signal, two-channel fluorescence cap-abilities are very important for calibrating fluorescence signals. This is particularly important for sensors that need to function within the complex environment of a living cell. While the field of RNA sensors is still in its infancy, we report the use of pairs of fluorogenic aptamer systems with demonstrated two-colour RNA– RNA or RNA–protein imaging capabilities either in vivo or in vitro. These examples suggest the future potential of such methods for the routine reporting of cellular state by fluorescent RNA reporters. A particular focus is placed on those applications capable of reporting cellular properties with accuracy and precision.",
        "Ratiometric Mango-SRB2 sensor for miRNA detection in live cells. The intrinsic binding orthogonality between the TICT-based MI and the CQ-based SRB2 aptamer (Table 1, No. 25 and 63) was used by Dou et al. to generate a ratiometric sensor able to report the concentration of mi-224 within HeLa cells.134 This sensor consists of an internal reference module containing MI and a SRB2-derived sensing module in which fluorescence can be activated by addition of target mi-224 RNA. These two modules were linked together by a dsRNA Dicer substrate andChem Soc Rev Review Article4090 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023under a single expression promotor (Fig. 8C). In a range of cell lines, a linear correlation between the SRB2 miRNA sensor signal to the MI reference was observed over one order of magnitude of mir-224 concentration range as determined by qRT-PCR.134 The authors also demonstrated that there was no FE detected for either MI:TO1-B or SRB2:SR-DN system both in vitro and in living cells when they were fused directly. This finding can be possibly explained by the misfolding of the two modules, due to proximal interaction, which demonstrates the requirement for structural rational design of biosensors.",
        "TICT-based orthogonal fluorogenic aptamer pairs for two-colour imaging. Spectral, FE, and binding affinity orthogonality is desired for site-specific multi-colour imaging and detection. As described previously (see Section 5.1), most of TICT-based light-up RNA aptamers harbour a G4 binding core, that lacks ligand discrimination abilities on its own. There are only a few studies that have demonstrated the success of two-colour RNA– RNA imaging in living cells using TICT-based RNA aptamers. For example, Dey et al. have generated a SAM target ratiometric sensor where a G4-based Broccoli:BI (Table 1, No. 13) was used as an internal reference and a non-G4-based Squash-SAM:DFHO (derived from Table 1, No. 19) was used as a sensing module.60 In this sensor, the green channel Broccoli:BI is inserted in one arm of the F30 aptamer scaffold, based on a highly stable viral three-way junction RNA motif,135 and the orange channel Squash-SAM:DFHO is inserted in another arm. The ratiometric signals monitored in cells correlate with the biochemical mea-surements of SAM levels, which demonstrates the use of this sensor for quantitative metabolite detection. However, further photophysical characterization of this system needs to be pro-vided. The highly spectral overlap between the BI and DFHO should be considered, whether it is compatible with commonly used filter sets on research microscopes and whether spectral deconvolution is necessary.",
        "Recently, another spectral and binding orthogonal pair Beetroot:DFAME and Corn:DFHO (Table 1, No. 20 and 14, Fig. 3C, highlighted in orange oval) has been used to visualize orthogonal RNA–protein assemblies in cells simultaneously.59 Since both Beetroot and Corn aptamers are homodimers, they enable the formation of orthogonal macromolecular assem-blies through dimerization interactions upon tagging multiple copies of each aptamer on the ROI. These RNA assemblies can not only be visualized by the fluorescence of RNA tags, but can also form larger RNA–protein assemblies by recruiting specific protein partners upon the combined use of the MS2-MCP and boxB-N-peptide systems. The constructs encoding 5 None Corn-MS2 and its binding partner MCP-mCherry, as well as 5 None Beetroot-boxB and its binder GFP-N-peptide, are all co-expressed in cells to simultaneously image the orthogonal assemblies. The ortho-gonality of the two RNP assembly species was demonstrated by the evidence that there was no observed co-localization of red and green fluorescent puncta labelled with mCherry and GFP respectively. Despite these initial multi-colour cell imaging examples, there is still growing demand for new fluorogenic RNA aptamer pairs with well-characterized spectral, binding and FE orthogonality. As promising candidates, the MIII.1 and P1This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4091pair (Fig. 3C, highlighted in blue oval) has demonstrated its orthogonality of E. However, the dual colour imaging of this pair in living cells needs to be further explored. RNA aptamer-FP fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a com-paratively simple and underutilized methodology to measure the concentration and diffusive properties of fluorescently tagged particles either in living cells or in cellular extracts. As an early FCS example using a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, the specific binding of ligand sulforhodamine B to SRB2-tagged mRNA was tested in the presence of total RNA Cos-7 cell extracts.136 Two-colour FCS (or FCCS) extends the capabilities of this methodology to allow the facile measurement of particle colocalization, binding stoichiometries, and biomolecule folding efficiency.137 Using MI:TO3-B (Table 1, No. 26) tagged 6S regulatory RNA and fusion RNA polymerase-EGFP, the asso-ciation of this RNP complex could be observed using two-photon FCCS in bacterial cell extracts.94 Another example of FCCS was to study the folding efficiency of the Broccoli aptamer. The fluor-escent signal from DFHBI-1T (Table 1, No. 12) was correlated with signal from a ATTO647N covalently linked to the aptamer distal to the ligand binding pocket.138 This technology requires the aptamer:ligand system to have slow exchange kinetics com-pared to the characteristic autocorrelation timescale of the FCCS experiment, which is likely to be met by many of the fluorogenic aptamers in Table 1. It can be simply adapted for cellular imaging and promises to yield many applications in eukaryotic cells.",
        "7.3 Single-molecule RNA detection in live and fixed cells Understanding how RNAs move and interact with other bio-molecules within a living eukaryotic cell is fundamental to understanding the many complex mRNA regulatory processes starting from its initial creation in the nucleus till its death in the cytoplasm. To date, three fluorogenic aptamer systems (two TICT and one CQ-based aptamers) have demonstrated single-molecule RNA detection in live mammalian tissue culture. Such imaging requires a complex optimization between the fluoro-genic system, the biology of the cell, and the microscope used to image the sample being studied. Many of the known biolo-gical constraints are summarized in Fig. 6 and a detailed analysis of the fluorophore/microscope constraints is beyond the scope of this review. It is essential to note that imaging contrast, directly related to E of light-up RNA aptamer systems, plays a critical role. Interestingly, the Mango and RiboGlow aptamers used for live cell imaging are quite resistant to formal-dehyde fixation, making these live cell imaging tools also useful for more routine spatial imaging of RNA within fixed cells. For context, we introduce the gold standard MS2 single-molecule RNA imaging system before discussing each of the fluorogenic aptamer imaging systems.",
        "MS2-based system. The MS2-MCP system developed by the Singer group, has been used extensively to image cellular RNAs.4,139 FP-based RNA tags have low contrast as the intrinsic fluorescence of the FP-MCP reporter, which need not be asso-ciated with the tagged ROI, is always present.140 For imaging of RNAs in the cytoplasm, this effect can be partially mitigated by4092 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023fusing nuclear localization tags to the FP-MCP RNA imaging report, allowing for higher contrast visualization of weak fluor-escent signals within the cytoplasm.141 This system is known to decrease the stability of mRNA within eukaryotic cells but recently improved versions appear to address this effect.142 FP-based methods also suffer further from comparatively slow oxygen-dependent maturation times of the fluorogenic centre.2 For all of these reasons, fluorogenic aptamers offer the potential to offer complementary and potentially competitive solutions to RNA imaging in live cells. These include potentially higher contrast imaging and ease of use. TICT-based Broccoli live cell imaging. To increase the stability of the Broccoli aptamer, it was incorporated into the F30 scaffold. Broccoli was placed into the F30 scaffold such thatfour copies were present, two such F30 constructs were in turn concatenated as shown in Fig. 10A, either once, twice or three times (8, 16, or 24 Broccoli monomers).56 The F30 repeat structure containing 24 aptamer copies RNA was 65% as bright as would have been expected from the brightness of 24 indivi-dual Broccoli aptamers, suggesting the presence of either misfolding or contact homo resonance energy (RE) quenching in such designs.56 This construct, when expressed in Cos-7 cells, lead to the observation of mobile fluorescent puncta (Fig. 10B). The half-life of these puncta, after the addition of actinomycin D (an inhibitor of transcription) together with the aggregation of these puncta into larger stress granules after arsenite or cold shock, was consistent with these puncta representing single-molecule RNAs.56 While fluorescence puncta were detected andThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098 |4093suggested to be single mRNA molecules, no tracking of indivi-dual particles were performed in this study. A key feature of this imaging was the staining of live cells with 10 micromolar of the BI ligand, which enabled imaging of puncta that could not be observed with DFHBI-1T (Table 1, No. 12 and 13). Broccoli binding to BI rather than to DFHBI-1T improved 1.88-fold brightness and gave a 6-fold higher binding affinity. A direct comparison of this system to the MS2 gold standard would be very useful to fully establish the potential of this system. TICT-based MII live and fixed cell imaging. The extremely high E of the MII aptamer enabled single mRNA imaging and tracking in live and fixed Cos-7/HEK293T cells.36,67 A core repeat of 3 None MII aptamers, each having distinct closing stem sequences, was 80% as bright as expected from three separate monomers, suggesting modest homo-RE based quenching or misfolding. This triplex unit was concatenated and a linear increase in fluorescence was observed, again, suggesting that the triplex was stable against higher order misfolding issues. Cos-9 cells transformed and induced with plasmids containing 8 repeats of this triplex (24 None MII aptamers total) produced puncta when stained with 200 nM TO1-B. Using a widefield fluorescence microscope, such puncta were observable both in fixed and live cells. The Mango signal was stable under pulsed illumination in both fixed and live cells. To perform two-colour imaging using both light-up RNA aptamer technology and FP-based RNA imaging methods, an ROI was dually tagged with MII and the MS2 binding motif. A third plasmid was then created that express a mRNA containing 8 copies of the MII triplex (24 None MII aptamers) and 24 copies of the MS2 binding motif (Fig. 10C). A construct encoding NLS-tdMCP-mCherry served to report the MS2 portion of the transcript. Fixing with 4% formaldehyde resulted in clear coloca-lization of puncta in the TO1-B and mCherry imaging channels, extending previous fixed cell dual RNA imaging using MII and immunostaining.36 In live cells, co-localization was again observed by comparing trajectories. Single particles were tracked for sustained periods of time (30 s) in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus67 (Fig. 10D). The 24 None MII tag was then used to demon-strate that the coding b-actin and noncoding NEAT-1 correctly localized when using this imaging tag.",
        "7.4 Super-resolution imaging of RNA. The fluorophore recycling feature of some fluorogenic aptamer systems (Fig. 5) promises many super-resolution applications in the future. Here, we summarize the observed fluorogenic recy-cling properties of aptamer systems and the super-resolution imaging results generated to date. Super-resolution imaging of RNA requires a combination of advanced microscopy and fluorogenic RNA methods. As this research area advances, more results are expected to be forthcoming in the future. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) using TICT-based Pepper:HBC620. The Yang laboratory developed the Pepper system, which is capable of photoexchange (Fig. 5) in live cells.35 Illumination with intense 458 nm laser light for approxi-mately 10 s resulted in rapid photobleaching that regenerated nearly completely after 60 s in the dark. This regeneration offluorescence was observed for 5 cycles with nearly complete regeneration being observed.35 The imaging properties of the Pepper:HBC620 system (Table 1, No. 52), proved to be superior to Broccoli:DFHBI-1T (Table 1, No. 12) and Pepper:HBC530 (Table 1, No. 50). It was used to perform SIM on cells where MS2-tagged Pepper:HBC620 (Table 1, No. 52) was tethered to a MCP-BFP-histone fusion protein. Excellent colocalization of the Pepper:HBC620 and BFP was observed using 3D-SIM, pointing out the power of this imaging system.35SIM using TICT-based MII. Analysis of MII None 24 containing puncta within formaldehyde fixed HEK293T cells revealed the fluorescent regeneration properties of the MII:TO1-B system (Fig. 5 and Table 1, No. 28). Using potassium-containing PKM buffer, required for MII G4 folding, supplemented with TO1-B, puncta could be photobleached within 5 s of confocal illumination. Nearly full recovery of fluorescence was observed after 5 s in the dark. Such cycles of could be repeated at least 700 times with only a minor loss in total observed fluorescence being observed.67 In contrast, Alexa Fluor 647 had photobleached to 40% of its original intensity. Permeability of fresh TO1-B was required for this effect as addition of a solid phase ProLong Diamond fixative did not result in fluorescent regeneration. This suggested that the photon budget of the MII system could be considerably extended, consistent with the long imaging times of RNA within live cells using MII.67 In addition to this, structured illumination could resolve structures at a 100 nm length scale, where colocalization was observed between MII tagged NEAT-1, which is known to localize in nuclear paraspeckles, and NONO protein immuno-stained with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated antibody.67Stimulated emission depletion (STED) using SP-based SiRA. Using spirocyclization, the Jäschke group demonstrated live cell STED using the SiRA imaging system with a far-red fluorophore (Fig. 10E and Table 1, No. 70).81 The photoexchange properties of this system (k4094 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 4071–4098This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry20238. Outlook Over the past decade, the rapid development of diverse fluoro-genic aptamer systems (Table 1) has led to a broad range of RNA tools for in vivo and in vitro use. As the fluorogenic aptamer field continues to mature, the applications for these exciting RNA research tools will continue to grow. Clearly as this field advances, more standardization, multi-channel ima-ging systems, and biological testing will be required to move to a truly ’plug and play’ set of tools for routine RNA research.",
        "8.1 Standardization of reporting for new fluorogenic aptamer systems The application of in vitro selection to RNA imaging tools is relatively recent, but many of the lessons learned from studying naturally occurring and artificial aptamers as well as ribozymes needs to be more uniformly applied to facilitate the development of RNA fluorogenic aptamers. Some key aspects are included here. Aptamer minimization and binding motif stability. It is important that new aptamer motifs be minimized and that the potential interaction of external sequences with the core aptamer sequence responsible for ligand binding be explored in greater detail. The existence of closing external stems in most characterized fluorogenic aptamers, is perhaps surpris-ing, but appears to serve the role of isolating the fluorogenic ligand binding core from random sequence domains during in vitro selection. They may also serve the additional, if inad-vertent, purpose of isolating fluorogenic aptamer binding domains from biological sequences. Such interactions between fluorogenic aptamers and external sequences need to be explored in much greater detail. Similarly, the effect of RNA helicases in eukaryotic cells and their effects on RNA G4 unfolding98 implies a direct effect on aptamer fluorescence, but remains to be resolved by the community. Similarly, the measuring how aptamers misfold is important to measure in vitro. Comparing fluorescence signals resulting from an excess of aptamer to that of an excess of fluorophore provides one way of studying such issues and should be routinely implemented. Perhaps most obviously, the exact sequence of the minimal aptamer sequence should be clearly presented to enable utilization by others. Binding properties. The measurement of binding affinities together with on-and off-rates will be increasingly important. Such measurements can be extremely challenging. High affinity (nM) aptamers require careful fitting procedures, which are starting to be routinely used in the field.34,77 Off-rates can be challenging to measure, particularly for low off-rate aptamers where 1on the order of half a day. The use of standard methodologies to measure off-rates (for example, BiaCore143) may have complex ramifications for understanding off-rates in a biological contexts. This is particularly important with the consideration that nearly all aptamers are selected against solid supports. More routine mea-surements of krate constants, the single-molecule microscopy assay can achieve near-molecular resolution by fitting the fluorescence blinking into a kinetic model.144,145 Measuring such properties in buffers that simulate the cellular environment are highly desirable. In addition to binding kinetics, the characterizations of a new fluorogenic aptamer should also include pH dependence, particularly over the range commonly used in vitro (pH 6 to 9), as well as metal ion dependence (Mg2+, K+, Na+) are of particular importance for in vivo work together with their corresponding Hill coefficients and chemical stability (such as resistance to formaldehyde and/or formamide).",
        "8.2 Biological testing and pairwise technological comparisons While adding significant work load, research groups should also be encouraged to directly compare the spectral orthogon-ality and biochemical fluorogenic properties of any new fluoro-genic aptamer systems with existing fluorogenic aptamers. This will become increasingly important as more two-or even three-channel RNA imaging systems are developed in the future. Such experiments are first most usefully performed in vitro but can be challenging if fluorophores are not easily available.",
        "Testing the biological compatibility of fluorogenic aptamer systems should be made to existing RNA imaging systems of the sort discussed in this review. Again, this is an extremely challenging subject that depends sensitively on the microscope infrastructure and the details of each fluorogenic system being used. Co-localization of fluorogenic aptamers with competing technologies should be used extensively to make direct com-parisons in a meaningful fashion and such comparisons are indeed starting to be made. The development of standards for single-molecule RNA and super resolution imaging involving fluorogenic regeneration will help ensure the progress of high-quality fluorescent imaging within the light-up RNA aptamer community. Using these standards, RNA imaging methods will become routinely useful to the biological research community. For such fluorogenic aptamer systems, care should be taken to point out potential compatibilities and incompatibilities with biological imaging applications at the time of publication.",
        "8.3 Moving to routine use ‘plug and play’ technology The routine imaging of cellular RNAs at the single-molecule level is now within the technological scope of the fluorogenic aptamer field. This new technology complements very well to the existing chemical and FP colour palettes, which have proven to be invaluable for the study of protein localization both in vitro and within living cells. Just as with FPs, more time is required for this existing field to fully mature. In addition to the demonstrated in vitro applications of these technologies in an ‘off the shelf’ format, further optimization of this technology will lead to many biological ‘plug and play’ applications.",
