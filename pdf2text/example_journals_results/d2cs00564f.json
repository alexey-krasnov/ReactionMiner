The three main synthetic approaches, namely P-chelation assisted C–H activation, oxidative addition and transmetalation, are described and compared. If a naphthyl fra-mework inherently predisposes a phosphorus atom and transition metal to interact, a rigid metallacycle may induce some strain and distortion, as apparent from the survey of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database (77 entries with metals from groups 7 to 11). Generally, the Np(P,C)-cyclometalation imparts high thermal and chemical robustness to the complexes, and a variety of stoichiometric reactions have been reported. In most cases, the metalacyclic structure is retained, but protodecyclometalation and ring-expansion have been sparingly observed. [Np(P,C)M] complexes have also proved to be competent and actually competitive catalysts in several transformations, and they act as key intermediates in some others. In addition, interesting phosphorescence properties have been occasionally pointed out.

Their interest ranges from fundamental bonding/reactivity aspects to applications in catalysis, materials chemical science, medicine, and others. The easy access, broad structural mod-ularity and versatile coordination properties of phosphines make them very powerful ligands for transition metals. It is thus not surprising that (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes occupy a forefront position.3–6 Here, PCP complexes I with a central benzene ring and two flanking phosphines have become the reference complexes (Chart 1).7 Their pincer structure results in a unique balance of stability/reactivity. The related (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes II featuring a single phosphine side-arm have also been widely investigated. In contrast, the corres-ponding naphthyl-based (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes III, hereafter denoted as [Np(P,C)M], long remained underdeve-loped although they are known for more than 50 years. Sig-nificant progress has been achieved over the past 5–10 years however, in particular, in gold(III) chemistry8 where the [Np(P,C)] framework opened new reactivity paths, enabled unprece-dented bonding situations to be authenticated and imparted unique catalytic activity. Here, this topic is reviewed. P,C-cyclometalated complexes derived from naphthyl phosphines as well as related systems featuring fused/p-extended systems, such as acenaphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene, are reported. The corresponding two arm stiff PCP complexes are not considered. [Np(P,C)] Complexes have been reported with metals from groups 7 to 11, in line with the preference of a soft phosphine moiety for mid and late transition metals. Emphasis is given to Chart 1 (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes I–III, content and organization of this review (metals in red are the most represented ones among [Np(P,C)M] complexes III).

Whenever possible, comparison is made with related phenyl-based (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes II. In the first part, the synthesis of [Np(P,C)M] complexes is presented. The three main synthetic approaches, namely P-chelation assisted C–H activation, oxidative addition and transmetalation, are described and compared. Then, the struc-ture and bonding of [Np(P,C)M] complexes are thoroughly analysed based on crystallographic and computational data. Special attention is given to the distortion/flexibility of a naphthyl spacer and its ability to accommodate a broad range of transition metals, despite its high rigidity. The following section deals with the reactivity of [Np(P,C)M] complexes in stoichiometric reactions and catalytic transformations. The (P,C)-cyclometalated framework is retained in most cases, but not always. Finally, a few photophysical studies performed on [Np(P,C)M] complexes are described. I. En route to Np(P,C)-cyclometalated complexes Three main synthetic strategies can be distinguished to access (P,C)-cyclometalated naphthyl complexes, [Np(P,C)M] (Fig. 1). They differ in the nature of pro-ligands and the way the transition metal is introduced. C–H activation, starting from simple 1-naphthyl phosphines, is naturally the most direct and common approach. It is also the oldest one, pioneered by Shaw et al. as early as in 1972. The C–H activation of 1-naphthyl phosphines occurs selectively at the peri position, due to ideal P-chelation (a 5-membered ring with rotation around the P– Cnaphthyl bond as the only degree of freedom). It can be promoted using a basic ligand on the metal or the addition of an exogeneous base/halide scavenger. This route has been used to prepare a broad range of (P,C)-naphthyl complexes with transition metals from groups 7 to 10. Recently, the renewed interest devoted to group 10 and group 11 metals has stimu-lated studies on alternative pathways to access (P,C)-naphthyl complexes based on the oxidative addition of C–X bonds or on the transmetalation of mercury/tin derivatives. These routes employ prefunctionalized 1-naphthyl phosphines as starting materials, with a halide or a metalloid at the peri position. Naphthalene derivatives with a phosphorus atom bridging the peri positions are also predisposed to give (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes. A few such species have been shown to undergo ring-expansion by the oxidative addition of the strained P–C bond to group 10 metals and gold. These three routes will be successively presented in detail in this section. 1. Via C–H activation With a unique and simple prefunctionalization on the naphtha-lene scaffold (to introduce the P atom), the activation of the peri C–H bond of 1-naphthyl phosphines is the most direct and common synthetic route to access [Np(P,C)M] complexes. This strategy was first described by Shaw in 1972 in a comprehensive study targeting [Np(P,C)Ir(III)] complexes.1 Different cyclometa-lation conditions taking the advantage of P-chelation were reported (Scheme 1). Starting from Ir(III) complex 1 bearing three dimethyl 1-naphthyl phosphines coordinated in a meridional fashion, the first cyclometalation reaction was achieved in a good yield (75%) by thermal activation (124 1C) in methyl glycol. A second C–H activation could be efficiently performed by heating mono-cyclometalated iridium complex 2 with an external base, sodium acetate. Interestingly, the coordination mode of the three phosphorus atoms around the iridium center changed from meridional to facial after this second cyclometalation step. In these two steps, an Ir–H species, formed by b-hydride elimination from the alcoholic solvent, was postulated as a key intermediate. This hydride could then act as an internal base, generating H2 as the by-product. No firm evidence for this mechanism was reported however. Concomitantly, the same strategy was tempted to prepare analogous rhodium complexes. The first electrophilic C–H activation worked well (84% yield). However, no further reactivity was observed in the case of [Np(P,C)Rh(III)] complex 2. An alternative pathway was also described to give bis-(P,C)-cyclometalated complex 3 starting from the iridium(I) precursor [IrCl(cod)]2. After a first C–H 3546 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023activation process by oxidative addition to iridium in boiling light petroleum, iridium(III) complex 5 was isolated in a very good yield (86%). 5 evolved quickly under reflux in methyl glycol to give complex 3 with gas evolution, presumably dihy-drogen. Finally, the third metalation process was performed by abstraction of the last chloride at iridium with a scavenger (i.e. AgBF4) to give tris-(P,C)-cyclometalated complex 4. Two years later, Shaw prepared a family of [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] complexes starting from cis-dichloroplatinum(II) precursor 6 (Scheme 2).2 Electrophilic C–H activation was performed by mixing PtCl2 with 6 to yield bridged platinum(II) dimer 7 after prolonged heating in xylenes (139 1C). For monomeric (P,C)-cyclometalated chloroplatinum(II) complex 8, the addition of sodium acetate was mandatory to obtain a good yield (77%). After halide exchange (chloride to iodide), alkyl and dialkylplatinum(II) complexes 10 and 11 were prepared using methyllithium. Pyrolysis at high temperatures (4195 1C) then afforded the corresponding iodo 12 and methyl (P,C)-cyclometalated 13 complexes with methane evolution. In these two seminal reports, Shaw thus depicted four different strategies to cyclometalate 1-naphthyl phosphines, including oxidative addition. The preparations of [Np(P,C)M] complexes via C–H activation reported after 1974 are described in the following sections. Although no detailed mechanistic studies have been carried out on the C–H activation process, these contributions have been organized according to the conditions used to promote cyclometalation: – Direct (electrophilic) C–H activation by a metal-halide (or metal-pseudohalide) precursor, – C–H activation in the presence of a mild base (NaOAc, Et3N), bonded to the metal or external, acting in concert with the metal or not, – C–H activation by a metal-alkyl precursor. a. Direct (electrophilic) C–H activation. The first examples described by Shaw involved metal chloride precursors and required quite high temperatures. Using more electrophilic pseudo-halide complexes (perchlorate and trifluoromethane sulfonate) enables operating under milder conditions. Accordingly, Yip described, in the late 2000’s, the synthesis of mono-and bis-(P,C)-cyclometalated complexes with p-extended naphthalene backbones (anthracene and pyrene) (Scheme 3).9,10 Here, pseudo-cationic palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes featuring diphosphine ligands were used as precursors. Cyclometalation proceeded within hours This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3547at room temperature in this case. Of note, double cyclometalations of 9,10-bis-phosphino-anthracene systematically gave a mixture of syn and anti-bis-(P,C)-cyclometalated complexes (with a syn/anti ratio of 4 60/40). In 2017, Zhu reported the synthesis of two [Np(P,C)Re] complexes starting from Re2(CO)10 (Scheme 4). 11 The exact way the peri C–H bond is activated is unknown but the authors invoked P-chelation assistance prior to intramolecular activation. b. C–H activation in the presence of a mild base (NaOAc, NEt3). The C–H metalation of 1-naphthyl phosphines assisted by a mild base, most often sodium acetate, is a simple, efficient and general strategy to prepare (P,C)-cyclometalated naphthyl complexes. Here, cyclometalation is based on the propensity of acetate to catch the peri H atom, thus facilitating the formation of the M–Csp2 bond. 12–14 Following Shaw’s pioneering contribution, the groups of Chi and Chou jointly reported in 2010 a stepwise preparation of phosphorescent [Np(Ph2P,C)Ir(III)] complexes (see Section IV). 15 First, the bis-N,C-cyclometalated iridium(III) chloride-bridged dimer was splitted by diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphines upon heating at 100 1C for 24 h (Scheme 5). The initially formed complex 24 with two strong field ligands (carbon and phos-phorus) at the trans position to each other could be isomerised 3548 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023into more thermodynamically stable complex 25 (within 48 h at 170 1C). Cyclometalation was then achieved in the presence of sodium acetate (5 eq.) at a high temperature (190 1C). In both cases, a mixture of complexes 26 and 27 was obtained. Based on the absence of thermal interconversion between 26 and 27, the authors proposed a stepwise process: the substitution of chlor-ide by acetate at iridium, followed by C–H bond activation/ metalation. A year later, the same groups described the preparation of a bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complex (Scheme 6).16 The elec-trophilic C–H activation of diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphines by [IrCl3(tht)3] at 196 1C in decalin first afforded the mono-(P,C)-cyclometalated complex [Np(Ph2P,C)IrCl2(tht)2] (83% isolated yield). Following the addition of diphenyl 1-naphthyl phos-phines, the second cyclometalation required the use of sodium acetate (5 equivalents) to give the [Np(Ph2P,C)]2Ir(k 2-OAc) complex. In 2017, the group of Zhu studied in detail the cyclometala-tion of diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphines by [Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Ir, Rh) in the presence of sodium acetate (Scheme 7).17 The reactions were performed in methanol at room temperature for 4 h. The cyclometalated complex [Np(Ph2P,C)IrCl(Cp*)] 30 was thereby obtained in a good yield (72%) along with a small amount of the corresponding non-cyclometalated iridium dichloride complex 31. The characterization of complex 31 supports a stepwise P-chelation assisted process for cyclometa-lation (an independent experiment actually confirmed the conversion of 31 to 30 over time). By comparison, the C–H bond activation seemed to be faster with rhodium, since the rhodium analogue of 31 was not observed during the reaction. In addition, the authors compared the reactivity of Csp2–H and Csp3–H bonds towards cyclometalation using a 1-naphthyl phosphine featuring a methyl group adjacent to phosphorus. Only the Csp2–H bond activation was observed with both iridium and rhodium. The cyclometalation of bis-1-naphthyl phosphines was then investigated (Scheme 8).18 With [Cp*IrCl2]2, very different out-comes were observed at room temperature depending on the substituent at phosphorus (R = Ph, tBu). Indeed, only P-coordination without cyclometalation was observed for the phenyl phosphine, whereas the tert-butyl phosphine directly afforded the cyclometalated complex [Np(tBu2P,C)IrCl(Cp*)]. Here, C–H activation was probably favoured as it relieved the strain induced by the high steric demand at phosphorus. Upon heating at reflux in methanol, both complexes converted into the corresponding bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, which were also prepared in high yields without heating using sodium acetate. With [Cp*RhCl2]2, no reaction occurred even upon heating, presumably due to lower electrophilicity of rhodium compared to that of iridium, but the addition of sodium acetate readily promoted cyclometalation, whatever the substituent at phosphorus. Yet, double cyclometalation could not be achieved in this case, even using a stronger base such as tBuOK. Zhu also applied the C–H activation route to prepare [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes (Scheme 9).19 Most convenient was to react 1-naphthyl phosphines with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 at room temperature in methanol in the presence of sodium acetate (4 eq.). Alternatively, non-cyclometalated phosphine complexes could be first prepared in dichloromethane without a base, and then stirred over silica gel under air to induce This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3549cyclometalation. An analogous complex [Np(Ph2P,C)RuCl(C6Me6)] was prepared soon after by Ishii starting from [(Z6-C6Me6)-RuCl2]2. 20 Given that o-tolyl phosphines were shown to undergo Csp3–H cyclometalation under the same conditions, the competi-tion between Csp2–H and Csp3–H activations was assessed by Zhu.19 Using iridium and rhodium, the 1-naphthyl phosphine featuring a methyl group adjacent to phosphorus was found to react with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2/NaOAc exclusively at the peri Csp2–H site. Under the NaOAc-assisted conditions, Grabulosa prepared in 2019 a series of [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes from optically pure P-stereogenic phosphines featuring naphthalene (Chart 2), phenanthrene and pyrene scaffolds for applications in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones (see Section III).21 The corresponding (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes were isolated in low yields (4–17%, except 49, 71%) probably due to decomposi-tion during purification by column chromatography. In most cases, they were obtained as diastereoisomeric mixtures (the ruthenium center becomes stereogenic upon cyclometalation). Only in the case of iPr-substituted phosphine, good phosphorus to ruthenium chiral induction was apparently achieved, with the formation of a single diastereoisomer according to 31P NMR spectroscopy. Base-assisted C–H activation has also been applied to pre-pare (P,C)-cyclometalated naphthyl complexes with group 10 metals. The first examples were reported by Shaw in 1998.22 Starting from the tri-1-naphthyl phosphine, a series of pallada-cycles were prepared as a result of monocyclometalation. With Pd(OAc)2, a dimeric acetate-bridged complex was obtained (Scheme 10). Subsequent treatment with acetyl-acetone gave the corresponding mononuclear acac complex [Np(Np2P,C)Pd-(acac)] which can be alternatively prepared by reacting PNp3 with [Pd(acac)2]. The analogous complex [ Np(Np2P,C)Pd(acac)] featuring an hexafluoro acetyl-acetonate co-ligand at palladium was prepared similarly. In 2005, the group of Herrmann applied the same strategy to synthesize palladacycles from the diphenyl 2-methylnaphthyl phosphine.23 Upon treatment with Pd(OAc)2, cyclometalation proceeded readily and efficiently under mild conditions, with complete selectivity for the peri Csp2–H bond. Finally, Vigalok and Vedernikov prepared in 2013 a Pt(II) complex using triethylamine as a base (Scheme 11).24 The naphthyl phosphine featured a methyl group adjacent to phos-phorus and again, complete chemoselectivity for Csp2–H over Csp3–H bond activation was observed. c. C–H activation by a metal-alkyl precursor. As mentioned above, the group of Shaw pointed out in 1974 the ability of metal-alkyl complexes to cyclometalate 1-naphthyl phos-phines, while the corresponding halide precursors remained unreactive.2 [Np(Me2P,C)Pt(II)] complexes were prepared using this way, although the reaction required harsh conditions (195– 200 1C, neat). In 2011, Goldberg reported a similar transforma-tion from the di-tert-butyl 1-naphthyl phosphine and [(m-SMe2)PtMe2]2 (Scheme 12). 25 Here, gas evolution, most likely methane, was observed right after mixing at room temperature. The cyclometalated complex [Np(tBu2P,C)Pt(SMe2)Me] was quickly (5 minutes) and efficiently obtained (89% isolated yield). The presence of a single phosphine per metal and the steric demand of the tBu groups at phosphorus are likely to trigger the C–H activation process via preorganization and/or strain release, which probably explains why the reaction pro-ceeded under very mild conditions in this case. 3550 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023In 2000’s, Klein and Beck extended the approach to first-row metals, namely cobalt and iron (Scheme 13).26 The diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphine was found to react smoothly with tri-methylphosphine Fe(II)Me2 and Co(I)Me precursors to give the corresponding (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes. The release of methane acts as a driving force and at the same time imparts irreversibility to cyclometalation. Metal-silyl precursors may also be used to cyclometalate 1-naphthyl phosphines, as substantiated by Corriu in 1981 (Scheme 14).27 Under UV irradiation, the di-carbonyl silyl iron complex [CpFe(CO)2SiPh2Me] was found to cleanly react with the P-stereogenic phosphine MePhP(Np). The cyclometalated complex [Np(PhMeP,C)FeCp(CO)] was obtained in 85% yield as a 1 : 1 mixture of diastereomers. The silane HSiPh2Me was concomitantly released (90% yield) and no deuterium incor-poration was observed when the reaction was performed in deuterated benzene, suggesting that the silyl group indeed participated in the C–H activation process, catching the peri H atom. Of note, the authors attempted to prepare an optically active form of the cyclometalated complex starting from the phosphine in a non-racemic mixture, but sadly, phosphorus epimerization was faster than coordination/cyclometalation under UV irradiation. d. O2-promoted C–H activation. In 2014, the group of Goldberg reported a peculiar route to a dinuclear hydroxy-bridged [Np(P,C)Pd(II)] complex (Scheme 15).28 The di-phosphine Pd(0) complex [(tBu2Np)2Pd] was found to readily react with dioxygen with the concomitant cyclometalation of the peri C–H bond and O–O cleavage. Reaction monitoring at low temperatures enabled an Z2-peroxo palladium complex to be authenticated as a key intermediate. Based on DFT calculations, the authors proposed a plausible path for the C–H activation, by addition across one of the Pd–O bond with the concomitant release of a phosphine. The resulting Pd–OOH species would then lose an oxygen atom to give the dimeric hydroxy-bridged complex [Np(tBu2P,C)Pd(m-OH)]2. 2. Via oxidative addition In 2002, the group of Mizuta reported an original P(III) peri-bridged naphthalene derivative (Scheme 16). This highly strained structure is prone to ring-expansion, as substantiated by the preparation of a [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] complex.29,30 The phos-phorus lone pair was first masked with a W(CO)5 fragment. Upon treatment with [Pt(PPh3)4], one of the P–C bonds oxida-tively added to platinum and one of the PPh3 co-ligands at platinum were then displaced by CO. Related [Np(P,C)Pd(II)] complexes were then synthesized by the same group using a similar strategy, using [Pd(PPh3)4] as the palladium(0) precursor.31 The phosphorus atom of the strained four-membered phosphacycle was preliminarily oxidized with hydrogen peroxide or elemental sulfur to give the corres-ponding P(V) pro-ligands. Oxidative addition of the strained P–C bond proceeded easily at room temperature to give the desired phosphapalladacycles in high yields (81–86%). Only one triphenylphosphine co-ligand remained coordinated to the palladium center. The complexes adopt dimeric structures with the PQE moiety (E = O, S) in a bridging mode. These results show the possibility to obtain (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes by the insertion of low valent metals into the strained four-This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3551membered ring of phosphorus peri-bridged naphthalenes, but the generality and practical utility of this approach are limited by the access to the starting P compounds. Naphthyl phosphines with halogen at the peri position are readily available from 1,8-dihalogenonaphthalenes.32 They are predisposed to undergo P-chelation assisted oxidative addition, as first demonstrated by our group in 2014 with gold.33 In the context of a lively debate about the feasibility of oxidative addition at gold, we described the straightforward synthesis of (P,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) complexes through the oxida-tive addition of a Csp2–I bond to a single gold(I) center under mild conditions (Scheme 17).33 P-chelation assistance was clearly substantiated by the spec-troscopic characterization of the instantaneously formed gold(I) complex, followed by the progressive build-up of the [Np(P,C)Au(III)I2] complex. Kinetic and computational studies shed light on the intramolecular and unimolecular characters of the process involving a three-center transition state. With the corresponding peri-bromo phosphine, oxidative addition could also be successfully achieved upon increasing the reaction temperature to 130 1C (instead of 25 1C for the peri-iodo phosphine, in line with the relative strengths of C–Br and C–I bonds). However, no reaction was observed with the corres-ponding peri-chloro phosphine, even after several hours at 130 1C in xylene. Calculations confirmed the higher activation barrier for the oxidative addition of the C–Cl bond (DG‡ = 39.7 kcal molNone1, compared to 32.1 kcal molNone1 for C–Br and 21.9 kcal molNone1 for C–I). Furthermore, in this case, the for-mation of the gold(III) complex is uphill in energy (+0.3 kcal molNone1) in contrast to the oxidative additions of the C–I and C–Br bonds (None9.1 and None7.2 kcal molNone1, respectively). Analo-gous [Np(P,C)AuI2] was subsequently prepared using the same approach using iPr and Cy substituents at phosphorus.34,35 We also studied the behaviour of copper in such a process and reacted peri-halo naphthyl phosphines with various Cu(I) complexes (Scheme 18).36,37 P-chelation was found to efficiently assist the oxidative addition of the C–I bond to copper, but the reaction did not stop there. The ensuing copper(III) species spontaneously underwent P–C reductive elimination to yield new peri-bridged phosphonio naphthalene. DFT calculations confirmed the feasibility and easiness of the C–I oxidative addition and P–C reductive elimination (activation barriers of 9.5 and 7.6 kcal molNone1 in DCM, respectively). The formation of the peri-bridged phosphonio naphthalene compound is exer-gonic by 12.3 kcal molNone1. The generality of the reaction was then examined. Replacing the iPr substituents at phosphorus either by a diamino (iPr)NCH2CH2N( iPr) moiety or Ph groups led to similar results. The halogen atom at the peri position was then varied, demon-strating that P-chelation enables copper to also activate C–Br and C–Cl bonds. Finally, efficient catalytic conditions were established to obtain peri-bridged naphthyl-phosphonium using only 1–5 mol% of copper(I) starting from peri iodo-or bromo-naphthyl phosphines (Scheme 19).38 3552 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023The ring strain of peri-bridged phosphonio naphthalenes is apparent from the acute CperiPCperi (77.341) and PCperiCbridge (86.991 and 86.571) bond angles. Given the rarity of intermole-cular (not chelation-assisted) oxidative additions to gold, we wondered about the possibility to insert gold into the P–C bond and to access thereby [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes. This proved indeed feasible, although it required relatively harsh conditions (Scheme 20). In 2021, Beckmann extended the P-chelation strategy and prepared [AcNp(Ph2P,C)Ni(II)] complexes (AcNp refers to ace-naphthyl) via the oxidative addition of C–X bonds (X = F, Cl, Br, and I) peri to phosphorus (Scheme 21).39 Once again, halide was observed to have a major impact on the rate of the C–X bond activation. Indeed, the oxidative addition of the C–I bond proceeded at –78 1C and that of the C–Br/C–Cl bonds at room temperature, while heating at 50 1C was required for the C–F bond. Highly air-sensitive dinuclear complexes were obtained. Addition of THF or MeCN subsequently gave rise to mono-nuclear complexes for X = Cl, Br, and I but not for X = F. 3. Via transmetalation Recently, Beckmann has developed a complementary transme-talation route (Scheme 22). Accordingly, the [AcNp(Ph2P,C)] group was transferred from mercury or tin to groups 9–11 transition metals (Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, and Au). Transmetalation from gallium to copper was also observed once, leading to a Cu cluster.40 The mercury(II)/tin(IV) derivatives are readily prepared from the corresponding peri-bromo acenaphthyl phosphine. They are non-reductive and bench stable. A transmetalation/redox process was first reported.41 The [AcNp(Ph2P,C)]2Hg(II) derivative slowly reacted with (tht)AuCl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) to give the cationic cis-[AcNp(Ph2P,C)]2Au + complex along with mercury(0). Note that the same gold(III) complex was obtained later on in the mixture with its trans isomer (cis/trans ratio = 15 : 85) upon the reaction of the [AcNp(Ph2P,C)Sn nBu3] derivative with half an equivalent of (tht)AuCl3. 42 The factors controlling the cis/trans stereochem-istry of gold(III) complexes remain unknown. When reacted with an excess of (tht)AuCl3, the tin derivative afforded the neutral [AcNp(Ph2P,C)AuCl2] complex (90% yield). This mononuclear gold(III) species could also be prepared in two steps, reacting the tin derivative with one equivalent of the gold(I) precursor (tht)AuCl, and oxidizing the ensuing (P,C)-bridged gold(I) dinuclear complex with PhICl2. Besides gold(III) complexes, the transmetalation/redox strategy was applied to the preparation of bis-(P,C)-cyclo-metalated rhodium(III) and platinum(IV) complexes by reacting This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3553[AcNp(Ph2P,C)]2Hg(II) with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 and [PtCl2(CH3CN)2], respectively (Scheme 23).43 The transmetalation approach also works with palladium, as substantiated by the reaction of [AcNp(Ph2P,C)Sn nBu3] with [PdCl2(CH3CN)2] (Scheme 24). 43 This led to a (P,C)-cyclometalated chloro-bridged dinuclear palladium(II) complex [AcNp(Ph2P,C)PdCl]2 analogous to the nickel complex obtained previously by the P-chelation assisted oxidative addition route. II. Structure and bonding analyses A CCDC database search reveals 77 X-ray structures of (P,C)-naphthyl cyclometalated complexes. The key geometric features were collected (see the ESI,† Table S1) so as to analyse the geometric constraints and distortions. These data have been sorted according to the metal: from group 7 (2 Re complexes) to group 8 (6 Fe and 8 Ru complexes), group 9 (2 Co, 1 Rh and 6 Ir complexes), group 10 (4 Ni, 13 Pd and 13 Pt complexes), and group 11 (22 Au complexes). First, looking at the bond distances, the P–M and M–Cperi distances were compared with the sum of the corresponding covalent radii,44 referring to the r parameters (Charts 3a and b). None of the structurally characterized complex shows a r(P–M) factor of above 1.00. About 20% of the structures, mainly Au complexes, possess a r(P–M) factor of 0.95–1.00. All the other complexes fall in the 0.90 None 0.05 range. The (P,C)-naphthyl backbone is thus very suited and very well accommodate all metals. It does not induce significant constraint on the P–M and C–M bond lengths. This feature is even more apparent from the r(M–Cperi) values that marginally deviate from 1.00 (87% fall in the 1.00 None 0.05 range). For bond angles, the bite angle (P–M–Cperi) varies very little, regardless of the transition metal and complex, with 88% of the registered structures displaying a value in between 82 and 851 (Chart 4a). Some in-plane distortions of the naphthalene scaf-fold are however observed, as apparent from the Cbridge–Cperi–M and P–Cperi–Cbridge bay angles (Charts 4b and c). While the Cbridge–Cperi–M bay angle does not deviate much from the ideal 1201 value (by 21 at most), the P–Cperi–Cbridge bay angle is systematically found below 1201, with 85% of the structures falling in the range of 110–1151. The ability of the (P,C)-naphthyl framework to accommodate different metals thus seems to mainly arise from the P atom and the Cperi–P bond. Out-of-plane distortions were also examined through the deviations of the P and M atoms at peri positions from the naphthalene plane (tilt angles a/a0, Charts 5a and b). In general, only minor deviations are observed. No correlation was found between the variations of a,a0 and r(P–M) (Charts S1 and S2, ESI†). The largest deviations concern the P atom (with out-of-3554 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023plane distortions a up to 101 and 94% of the structures in the 4– 101 range) while the metal usually remains close to the naphthalene plane (71% of the structures display a0 values between 1 and 51). It is to note that even if the deviations are small, the P and M atoms are systematically tilted in opposite directions (up and down the naphthalene plane), probably to minimize steric repulsions between the substituents at phos-phorus and the co-ligands at M. The bonding situation within [Np(P,C)M] complexes has been occasionally assessed by computational means. Mebs, Hupf and Beckmann performed atom-in-molecules, electron localizability indicators and non-covalent interaction analyses on rhodium, nickel, palladium, platinum and gold complexes.39,42,43 In all cases, the P–M and C–M bonds were found to be of polar covalent nature. The covalent and ionic contributions are slightly lower in the P–M bonds than in the C–M bonds. III. Applications of [Np(P,C)M] cyclometalated complexes: stoichiometric reactivity and catalytic transformations In this section, the stoichiometric reactivity and catalytic appli-cation of cyclometalated naphthyl (P,C) complexes will be presented. It is organized per metal, starting from gold(III), then palladium(II), platinum(II/IV), iron(II) and ruthenium(II). In most cases, the metalacyclic structure is retained and these reactions Chart 4 Histograms showing the distribution (in percentage) of the bite angle (a), the Cbridge–Cperi–M bond (b) and the P–Cperi–Cbridge bond angle (c) among crystallographically characterized [Np(P,C)M] complexes.

Finally, miscellaneous examples involving the cleavage of the M–C bond are discussed. 1. [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes In the previous section, we presented the easy access to cyclometalated (P,C)-Au(III) complexes via chelate-assisted oxi-dative addition of the C–X bond to gold(I). The rigid nature of the (P,C) naphthyl ligand and its strong coordination to gold gives highly stable derivatives and allows us to explore the reactivity of gold(III) complexes. Most of the elementary steps (migratory insertion, b-H elimination, etc.) known with isoelectronic metals (nickel(II), palladium(II) and platinum(II)) were not described with gold(III) complexes a decade ago. In this section, we present our work consisting of meticulous experimental and theoretical studies aiming to demonstrate the ability of gold(III) to efficiently undergo these elementary transformations. For this purpose, we took advantage of the selective mod-ulation of cyclometalated (P,C)-AuI2 giving easy access to P;Cð Þ-AuR02 complexes by the reaction with the corresponding Grignard reagent (Scheme 25).34,45,46 In the presence of one equivalent of an organometallic reactant, the organic fragment sits trans to the phosphorus as apparent from NMR ( JC–P Z 100 Hz for trans isomer compared to 5.7 Hz for methyl at the cis position in Np(P,C)-AuMe2) and in line with trans effects. a. Migratory insertion of alkenes in Au(III)–C bonds. In 2015, we took advantage of the robustness of the [Np(P,C)AuMe2] complex to demonstrate the feasibility of the migratory insertion of alkenes into Au(III)–C bonds (Scheme 26).34 The 3-coordinated cationic gold(III) complex was generated by methyl abstraction with tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane. Due to its high electrophilicity, it proved highly unstable and spontaneously grasped a pentafluorophenyl group from the borate counter-anion to give the neutral [Np(P,C)AuMe(C6F5)] complex (obtained as a mixture of cis/trans isomers). The 3-coordinated cationic gold(III) complex could nevertheless be trapped before to rearrange, as substantiated with 2,6-lutidine. The reaction of [Np(P,C)AuMe2] with B(C6F5)3 was then carried out in the presence of alkenes with the aim to achieve migratory insertion. Using ethylene or styrene, no sign of alkene incorporation was observed, but with norbornene (nbe), a strained and more reactive alkene, double insertion into the Au(III)–Me bond occurred (Scheme 27). The ensuing gold(III) complex was isolated and fully characterized (HRMS, NMR spectroscopy, and XRD) after trapping with tetrabutylam-monium chloride (or pyridine). Syn additions across the CQC double bond of nbe attested unequivocally to the inner-sphere migratory addition process (as opposed to the usual outer-sphere addition anti to gold). The mechanism of this reaction was thoroughly investigated by computational and experimental means (Scheme 28).34,47 Accordingly, it classically involves coordination–insertion of alkene and because of the electronic dissymmetry of the cyclometalated (P,C) ligand, the first insertion was found slightly more demanding energetically than the second one (activation barriers of 18.7 and 15.7 kcal molNone1, respectively), in line with the observation of double insertion. Low-temperature monitoring by NMR spectroscopy enabled detecting two key intermediates: the first p-alkene complex and the double inser-tion product before trapping with chloride. The latter species represents the first example of an agostic complex with gold. Coordination of the g C–H bond of the bis-norbornyl moiety to 3556 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023gold was apparent from the reduced 1JCH coupling (97 Hz) as well as NBO and AIM analyses.48 We then envisioned to extend the migratory insertion of alkenes to gold(III) aryl complexes, with the idea to access and characterize p-arene gold(III) complexes (Scheme 29).49,50 Such species were proposed as the initial stage of the C–H activation of arenes at gold(III). The [Np(P,C)Au(Ph)I] complex was reacted with AgSbF6 in the presence of norbornene. Here, mono-insertion took place rapidly and cleanly to give a p-arene gold(III) complex. According to NMR spectroscopy, XRD analysis (of the p-methoxy derivative) and DFT calculations, the arene moiety is Z2-coordinated to gold. The reaction profile of nbe insertion into the Au(III)–Ph bond was analysed by DFT calcula-tions. Coordination–insertion was found to be facile (with an even lower activation barrier than that for the Au(III)–Me complex, 10.7 vs. 18.7 kcal molNone1). Then, cis/trans isomerization proceeds readily to give the p-arene gold(III) complex obtained. Of note, the auration of p-coordinated arene could be triggered easily by adding a base such as the proton sponge. This demonstrates the relevance of such p-arene complexes to the electrophilic metalation of arenes at gold(III). b. b-Hydride elimination. As pointed out by Köppel and Hashmi in 2013, b-hydride elimination is intrinsically highly disfavoured in gold(I) alkyl complexes. With a d8 configuration, gold(III) alkyl complexes are a priori more prone to b-H elimina-tion, although direct experimental evidence was long lacking. Taking advantage of the stability of [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes, we carried out in 2016 a comprehensive study on 3-coordinated cationic gold(III) n-alkyl complexes (Scheme 30).45 The target compounds (nPr and nBu) were easily generated by reacting the corresponding neutral iodide complexes with AgNTf2 at –90 1C, and their reactivity was monitored by variable-temperature NMR spectroscopy. Accordingly, above 0 1C, the n-propyl complex was found to transform into the known cationic bis-cyclometalated species with the concomitant release of propy-lene as a result of b-hydride elimination (propane is also formed by a bimolecular pathway). A similar process was observed from the corresponding n-butyl gold(III) complex, with the release of cis and trans 2-butenes, as well as butane (Scheme 31). The formation of internal alkenes indicates that the initially generated 1-butene rapidly re-inserts into the Au(III)–H bond resulting in a chain walking process. Computational studies have estimated the activation barriers for such b-H eliminations to 8–14 kcal molNone1 (compared to o2 kcal molNone1 for the olefin re-insertion into the Au(III)–H bond). In addition, reacting the corresponding [Np(P,C)Au(III)] methyl complex with ethylene (7 bars) at 50 1C afforded a mixture of propene and butenes. Here, the slow insertion of ethylene into the Au(III)–Me bond is followed by rapid b-H elimination. A reaction sequence involving coordination–insertion and b-hydride elimination was also observed by reacting the [Np(P,C)Au(III)Ph] complex with ethylene (Scheme 32).49 In this case, styrene re-insertion is very facile, much more than its dissociation. As a result, the reaction gives a gold(III) styryl complex stabilized by p-arene coordination. c. p-Allyl gold(III) complexes. While palladium(II) p-allyl complexes are iconic in organometallic chemistry, analogous gold(III) species remained elusive until recently. In 2020, we took advantage of the rigid and robust [Np(P,C)Au(III)] platform to prepare and study p-allyl gold(III) complexes (Scheme 33).46 They were readily prepared from the corresponding neutral s-allyl precursors, by iodide abstraction with AgSbF6. The thorough analysis of the bonding situation by NMR spectro-scopy, XRD and DFT calculations revealed the static and highly symmetric Z3-coordination of the p-allyl moiety to gold. Of note, the related (N,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) p-allyl complexes prepared simultaneously and independently by Tilset proved to adopt highly fluxional and unsymmetric s + p structures instead.51 To draw parallel with palladium(II) complexes, we reacted the [Np(P,C)Au(III)] p-allyl complexes with b-dicarbonyl carbanions. The corresponding C–C coupling products were obtained in good to excellent yields, as the result of nucleo-philic addition to the p-coordinated allyl moieties. A meticulous mechanistic study combining in situ NMR mon-itoring at low temperatures and DFT calculations revealed a complex and rich picture for this apparently simple transforma-tion (Scheme 34).35 If the C-allylation product is readily obtained whatever the p-allyl substitution (R = H, Me) and b-dicarbonyl nucleophile (R0 = OEt, Ph), nucleophilic attack can occur initially at either the terminal or the central positions of p-allyl, as well as at the metal itself. Reactive intermediates resulting from these 3 competitive paths were actually all authenticated spectroscopically and/or crystallographically. For palladium(II) p-allyl complexes, the regioselectivity of the nucleophilic addition is under orbital rather than charge control. The close inspection of the molecular orbital diagram for [Np(P,C)Au(III)] p-allyl complexes showed the presence of three vacant orbitals with major contributions of gold and the terminal/central positions of p-allyl within a small energy gap. This explains why nucleophilic attacks to the 3 sites are intrinsically in competition. Of note, p-allyl gold(III) complexes were amenable to catalytic allylation. Using a P^N hemilabile ligand, we could cross-This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3557couple allyl acetates and alcohols with indoles with complete selectivity for the branched C3-allylated products.52 d. Hydroarylation of alkynes catalysed by [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes. The ability of [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes to engage in migratory-insertion, C–H activation and b-H elimination prompted us to consider their possible use as catalysts in the intermolecular hydroarylation of alkynes.53 This transforma-tion, pioneered by Fujiwara with platinum and palladium complexes,54,55 gives straightforward access to styrene deriva-tives and represents an attractive alternative to the Heck coupling, using aryl-H instead of aryl-X substrates. This formal addition of aryl-H bonds to alkynes prevents the pre-functionalization of the arene substrate. (P,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) complexes 110 and 111 with labile trifluoroacetate OAcF co-ligands were readily prepared. Using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as a co-solvent facilitates OAcF dissociation and enables operating under silver-free conditions. Using the addition of 1,3,6-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) to diphenylacetylene (DPA) as the test reaction, the (P,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) complexes proved extremely active, while the related (N,C)-cyclometalated complexes showed no or low activity (Scheme 35). Poor results 3558 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023were also observed with a (P,C,P) gold(III) complex as well as a non-cyclometalated gold(I) complex. The [Np(P,C)Au(III)] com-plexes are thus unique to show high robustness and activity in this transformation. Substituting the phosphorus atom by a Ph instead of an iPr group reduces the steric hindrance and increases the electrophilicity of the gold(III) center, resulting in enhanced activity. Ultimately, the coupling of TMB and DPA could be achieved in a 98% yield at 0.1 mol% loading within 3 h. [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes showed high activity with a rather broad scope of substrates (Chart 6). The reaction works efficiently with internal alkynes featuring aryl, alkyl, ester and keto substituents, as well as terminal alkynes. Other electron-rich arenes than TMB can also be used, including dialkoxy-benzenes, durene and mesitylene. In all cases, hydroarylation is fully regioselective, and it is generally fully stereoselective, affording the anti-addition product. A priori, two paths are conceivable to account for such Au(III)-catalyzed arene/alkyne coupling (Scheme 36). One involves the p-coordination of the alkyne to gold yielding 119, the outer-sphere nucleophilic addition of the arene and finally proto-deauration. The other one starts by the C–H activation of the arene affording 117, followed by the migratory insertion of the alkyne and finally protodeauration. The outer-sphere path was initially inferred indirectly, based on the observed formation of the anti-addition products. A thorough mechanistic study was then performed,56 to track reactive intermediates and better understand the factors at play. Accordingly, using B(C6F5)3 as the co-catalyst instead of TFA as the co-solvent enabled us to characterize by low temperature NMR spectroscopy the cationic complex [Np(P,C)Au(OAcF)]+, the active species easily shifting from k2 to k1-OAcF coordination, and its TMB adduct This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3559[Np(P,C)Au(OAcF)(TMB)]+, an off-cycle resting state and actually the first Wheland-type s-arene complex of Au(III) to be authen-ticated. The key p-alkyne complex was also generated and characterized in the gas phase by mass spectrometry using ion-molecule collision techniques. The energy profiles for the coupling of TMB/DPA were also analysed computationally and the outer-sphere path was found to be much less demanding energetically than the inner-sphere mechanism. e. A Schrock-type nucleophilic Au(III) carbene complex. In contrast with electrophilic Fischer-type gold(I) carbene com-plexes, which are now relatively well-established and under-stood species, gold(III) complexes with a reactive carbene moiety were elusive until recently. In 2017, the groups of Mézailles and Bourissou combined a geminal dianion stabilized by electron-withdrawing PV substituents with a [Np(P,C)Au(III)]I2 complex to prepare an original gold(III) carbene complex (Scheme 37).57 The gold center is in square-planar environment, as expected for gold(III), and the carbene center is its trigonal planar geometry. One of the P(QS)Ph2 side-arm is coordinated to gold, and the other remains pendant. Variable-temperature 31P NMR indicated a dynamic situation, with the rapid exchange of the two P(QS)Ph2 moieties at room temperature. The 13C NMR signal for the carbene center was found at d 18.2 ppm, very much shielded compared to those of electro-philic cationic Au(I) carbene complexes (d from 200 to 321 ppm), indicating a completely different bonding situation and an electron-rich carbene center. Consistently, DFT calcula-tions revealed a high energy HOMO centered at the carbene center. The nucleophilic, Schrock-type character of the carbene center was actually substantiated experimentally by Wittig-type reactions with phenylisothiocyanate and CS2. 2. [Np(P,C)Pd(II)] complexes In 1998, Shaw demonstrated the high catalytic activity and robustness of [Np(P,C)Pd] acetate and acetylacetonate com-plexes 128 and 129 in the Heck reaction (Scheme 38).22 The coupling of iodobenzene and styrene could be achieved at extremely low catalytic loadings (down to 0.0001 mol%) under forcing conditions (up to 13 days at 95 1C) to reach TON as high as 1 120 000. Of note, related cyclometalated complexes derived from benzyl phosphines led to significant lower TON (900 at best). A few years later, Herrmann extended this study to bromo-and chloro-arenes, working at 130 1C and 0.1 mol% catalyst loading.23 Under these conditions, the Heck coupling products could be obtained in high yields from bromo-arenes (with TON up to 1,000) but not from chloro-arenes (29% at best). With these more challenging substrates, the [Bn(P,C)Pd] complexes perform best, with TON values up to 329 000 achieved from bromo-arenes. Conversely, Hou obtained good results with the rigid (P,C)-naphthyl ligand in the intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of bicyclic alkenes with terminal ynones affording polysubstituted furans.58 An exhaustive catalyst screening was conducted, from simple commercially available Pd compounds to (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes derived from binaphthyl, biphenyl, benzyl and naphthyl phosphines. Good yields (460%) were only obtained when using [Np(P,C)Pd] complexes. Recently, Yamamoto applied 9-(diphenylphosphino)anthra-cene-based phosphapalladacycles as catalysts for the conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to electron-deficient alkenes (Scheme 39).59 In situ tests using Pd(OAc)2 and phosphines showed the higher performance of the anthracenyl phosphine (95% yield in coupling product from phenylboronic acid and PhCHQCHC(QO)Ph) over the corresponding naphthyl phos-phine (Ph2PNp, 53%) and triphenylphosphine (o5%). Using the preformed [Ant(P,C)Pd] complex with P(OEt)3 as the co-ligand, the catalytic loading could be decreased to 0.2–0.5 mol% keeping high reactivity over a large substrate scope. 3. [Np(P,C)Pt(II/IV)] complexes In 2011, Goldberg reported the C–H activation of benzene upon thermolysis (100 1C) of a cyclometalated [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] methyl complex in C6D6 (Scheme 40). 25 Methane was identified as the co-product (with CH3D as the major isotopomer) and the addition of an excess of SMe2 was found to inhibit the C–H activation. The authors thus proposed a mechanism involving the displacement of SMe2 by benzene-D6 at platinum, followed by the oxidative addition of a C–D bond/reductive elimination of CH3D or a s-bond metathesis process. In the context of the electrophilic fluorination of arenes with high valent transition metals, Vigalok and Verdernikov investi-gated the oxidation of [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] aryl complexes with XeF2 (Scheme 41).24 The ensuing platinum(IV) complexes showed moderate stability and evolved at 20–60 1C via an 1,3-aryl migration from the platinum center to the b-carbon of the naphthyl fragment to yield (P,C,C)Pt(II) pincer complexes. 3560 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Based on DFT calculations, the authors proposed a stepwise mechanism for this unprecedented Csp2–Csp2 coupling. Follow-ing pyridine dissociation and C–C coupling, the aryl group would migrate from the a-position to the b-position of the naphthyl ring to generate a naphthylidene complex. Finally, deprotonation of the naphthyl ring would restore the aromatic naphthalene system. 4. [Np(P,C)Fe(II)] complexes The [Np(P,C)Fe(II)] methyl complex was found by Beck and Sun to be unstable thermally (Scheme 42).60 The iron center is in octahedral geometry with the Me group at the cis position to the carbon atom of the (P,C)-cyclometalated ligand. Upon gentle heating (40 1C, 4 h), reductive elimination took place to give the corresponding C-methylated naphthyl diphenylphosphine. Nonetheless, some stoichiometric reactions with the retention of the cyclometalated Np(P,C) framework were also reported. With carbon monoxide, the ligand exchange of one trimethyl-phosphine co-ligand proceeded smoothly at room temperature, while C–H activation occurred with terminal alkynes to give the corresponding acetylide complexes with release of methane.

[Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes were applied to the catalytic reduction of ketones by transfer hydrogenation with isopropanol. In 2007, Zhu compared the catalytic activities of various p-cymene phosphine complexes under similar conditions: 0.5 mol% catalyst loading, 82 1C (boiling iPrOH), 48 h, KOH (20 eq.) (Scheme 43).19 Whatever the substituent at phosphorus (Ph or iPr), the [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complex showed lower activity (70–90% yields for the reduction of benzophenone) compared to the non-cyclometalated complex (498% yield) and the benzyl cyclometalated complex (96% yield). However, a significant increase in yields was observed upon introducing a methyl group at the o-position of phosphorus of the [Np(iPr2P,C)Ru] complex (from 70 to 98%). Two years later, Grabulosa envisioned to develop an asym-metric version by chirality transfer from a P-stereogenic center to the ruthenium center (Scheme 44).21 Starting from homo-chiral naphthyl phosphines, the cyclometalation step pro-ceeded with disappointingly low diastereoselectivity (d.r. = 1 : 2.4 for R = Me and d.r. = 1 : 1.6 for R = MeO). Only the iPr-substituted phosphine induced full control of the ruthenium chiral center, but unfortunately, the cyclometalated complex was formed in a very low yield (15%). Evaluation of these [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes in asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone reveals very low, if any, enantioselectivity (ee o 5%). Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that cyclome-talation of the naphthyl phosphinite ligand (R = OMe) resulted in a noticeable increase of the catalytic activity (from 45% yield in reduction product after 3 h with the non-cyclometalated complex, to 99% yield with the cyclometalated complex). 6. Miscellaneous examples involving M–C cleavage [Np(P,C)M] metalacycles are very robust and in all the previously described reactions and catalyses, they remain intact through-out the transformations. However, M–C bond cleavage was found to occur in a few cases, presented hereafter. a. [Np(P,C)Re] complexes. In 2017, the group of Zhu inves-tigated the decyclometalation of [Np(P,C)Re] complexes11 inspired by the work of Lu on homologous N,C-cyclometalated complexes.61 The cleavage of the Re–C bond was achieved under UV irradiation at room temperature in chloroform or bromoform to yield the corresponding rhenium halide com-plexes. Protodecyclometalation was also reported with trifluor-oacetic acid under photolytic conditions at room temperature. The photolysis of various (P,C)Re cyclometalated complexes in the presence of aryl halides in benzene was then investigated (Scheme 45). The corresponding biphenyl products were thereby obtained in high yields (80–98%) and short reaction times (few hours) along with the decyclometalated Re com-plexes (as a result of formal HX trapping). Taking advantage of the facile cyclometalation of naphthyl phosphines at rhenium in the presence of a base, the cross-coupling of 4-bromoanisole and benzene (used as the solvent) was then possible under catalytic conditions, in the presence of 1 equivalent of sodium hydroxide (Scheme 46). Of note, the ancillary Np(P,C) ligand was found to outperform its more flexible Csp3 variant (59 vs. 26% yield) and replacing the Ph groups at phosphorus for iPr led to an increase in stability of the rhenium catalyst (no free ligand observed with iPr) and thus a better yield in the coupling product (68%). b. [Np(P,C)Ru] and [Np(P,C)Rh] complexes. In the course of their work on the insertion/remote rearrangement of internal 3562 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023alkynes in ruthenium complexes, the group of Ishii reported a rare example of P–C reductive elimination at ruthenium (Scheme 50).20 When exposed to an halide abstractor and an internal alkyne, the [Np(P,C)Ru] complex undergoes the 1,2-insertion of the alkyne (R = alkyl or aryl) in the Ru–C bond followed by P–C reductive elimination to yield sandwich complex 146. This mechanism was supported by the isolation of intermediate 147 resulting from the 1,2-insertion of diphe-nylacetylene in the presence of NaBArF4 at room temperature. Heating at 70 1C for 24 hours allows the P–C reductive elimina-tion to take place. Phosphalenium salts can then be released using oxidants (I2 and CuCl2) or CO. 62 Recently, Ishii synthesized the analogous alkenyl rhodium(III) complex coordinated with pentamethylcyclopenta-dienyl (Cp*) by the 1,2-insertion of diphenylacetylene in the presence of NaBArF4 (Scheme 51). 63 An addition of 1.0 equiva-lent of di-p-tolylacetylene to this complex results in an equili-brium between the two corresponding alkenylrhodium complexes with a 43 : 57 ratio. The authors proposed that an alkyne exchange occurs via b-carbon elimination, for which the activation barrier was estimated computationally to be acces-sible (15.6 kcal molNone1). This represents one of the rare examples of b-carbon elimination from an alkenyl complex (i.e. the reverse process of alkyne insertion). Recently, Zeng reported an original Ru-catalyzed alkylation of naphthyl phosphines occurring selectively on the remote C5 position (Scheme 47).64 The transformation proceeds under relative mild conditions (50–80 1C) with bromo-alkanes as alkylating reagents. It takes advantage of the facile and rever-sible formation of [Np(P,C)Ru] complexes by phosphine-directed cyclometalation/protodemetalation. Bromo alkanes are proposed to oxidize the ruthenium center via a single-electron transfer (SET), the alkylation would then occur by radical electrophilic substitution on the naphthyl ring. The high C5-regioselectivity (C5/others 420/1) is tentatively assigned to the inductive effect of the Np(P,C)Ru metallacycle. In 2018, Yu and Che described jointly the Rh-catalyzed peri arylation of naphthyl phosphines (Scheme 48).65 Using 2.5 mol% of [Rh(cod)Cl]2 and 3 equivalents of tBuOLi as a base, naphthyl phosphines could be efficiently coupled with bromo-arenes (within 24 h at 110 1C) as well as chloro-arenes (within 24 h at 150 1C) in good to high yields. The reaction is fully selective for peri arylation and works with bromo/chloro hetero-arenes as well. Mechanistic studies by mass spectrometry suggest a Rh(I)/Rh(III) catalytic cycle. The bis-phosphine complex [Np(P,C)Rh(PPh2Np)] was proposed to be the active species. Very recently, Hierso and Roger extended this methodology to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular 1-pyrenyl diphenylphosphine (Scheme 49).66 The reaction works well with a large scope of bromo-arenes substituted by electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, as well as bromo-heteroarenes. It is fully selective for the arylation of the position peri to phosphorus, and is also applied to phenanthryl and fluoranthenyl phosphines. The [Rh(I)(cod)2]BF4 and [Rh(Cp*)Cl2]2 complexes can be used and gave similar results. (P,C)-cyclometalated Rh(III) complexes were prepared and their activities were evaluated. The neutral species gave poor results and was assumed to be a deactivated out-of-cycle resting state, while the di-phosphine cationic complex showed high catalytic activity. IV. Luminescence properties and optoelectronic applications of [Np(P,C)M] complexes 1. [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] complexes In 2009, Yip reported an interesting study on (P,C)-cyclometalated platinum complexes derived from pyrenes.10 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3563The fluorescence properties of pyrene derivatives are well-known and widely used, while phosphorescence is usually very weak. Phosphorus substitution and subsequent cyclometala-tion of the peri C–H bond were envisioned as a mean to introduce Pt on the pyrene ring and benefit from the internal heavy-atom effect to enhance phosphorescence. Accordingly, the mono and dimetallic platinum complexes 18 and 20 showed phosphorescence at lem 611–627 nm in oxygen-free acetonitrile solution at room temperature, with quantum yields of 0.44–1.5% and lifetimes of 31.3–63.7 ms (Fig. 2). The heavy-atom effect of Pt was supported by the very weak phosphores-cence of the related Pd dinuclear complex under the same conditions (lem 650 nm, quantum yields o 0.001%). Cyclome-talation is beneficial, as apparent from comparison with the corresponding metalated platinum(II) complex lacking (P,C)-cyclometalation.67 The related complexes with dangling (non-cyclometalated) Pt centers showed very weak phosphorescence if any. Note that the same authors performed a similar photophy-sical study on analogous anthracene-derived complexes two years before.9 The bis-cyclometalated complexes were found to emit at lem B 460–510 nm in the dichloromethane solution at room temperature, with quantum yields of 1–6% and short half-lifetimes o2 ns (Fig. 3). Only weak fluorescence was observed in this case, with no apparent enhancement of phosphorescence due to the heavy-atom effect. Comparison of the syn and anti-isomers revealed little changes, while the corresponding mono-cyclometalated complex showed weaker fluorescence (0.16% quantum yield) with a too-short lifetime to be measured. 2. [Np(P,C)Ir(III)] complexes Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes such as [(phenyl-pyridyl)3Ir] are strong phosphorescent emitters of interest for optical devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Varying the ligands at iridium offers a simple means to modulate and eventually improve the stability and photophy-sical properties of the complexes. In this regard, Chi and Chou jointly studied in 2010 heteroleptic complexes combining two C^N and one P^C cyclometalated ligands (Fig. 4).15 Attempts to 3564 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023prepare analogous complexes from benzyldiphenylphosphine failed, preventing the authors to assess the influence of the naphthyl ring on the luminescence properties. Whatsoever, complexes 26 and 27 proved robust (as long as the N^C ligand is equipped with a fluorine atom) and phosphorescent in oxygen-free dichloromethane solution at room temperature with lem of 530–650 nm and quantum yields from 1.6 to 100%. Significantly higher quantum yields were systematically observed for the complexes in which the two nitrogen atoms occupy cis positions. The impact of the N^C cyclometalated ligand at iridium was thoroughly examined. Thanks to time-dependent DFT calculations, the emission transitions were shown to involve MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) and LLCT (ligand-to-ligand charge transfer) or MLCT and ILCT (intra-ligand charge transfer), depending on the N^C ligand. In particular, the (P,C)-naphthyl ligand was proposed to act as the CT acceptor when iridium is ligated by the phenyl-pyridine ligand. Of note, the proof of the feasibility of incorporating such complexes in devices was substantiated. Orange-red emit-ting OLEDs with decent quantum efficiencies (up to 12.5% at 500 cd mNone2 brightness) were prepared. In a following study, the same authors further extended the structural diversity of iridium(III) emitters.16 Complexes with one N^N azolate ligand and two P^C-cyclometalated ligands derived from diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphine (or its isoquino-line analog) were shown to also display phosphorescence (with lem of 530–640 nm and quantum yields from 11 to 100%) (Fig. 5). Conclusions As shown in this review, (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes derived from naphthyl phosphines have been discovered early on but long remained neglected. They have however attracted growing interest recently and been shown to display rich chemistry and open interesting perspectives. The chemistry of the [Np(P,C)] complexes is now much more developed than that of the related [Np(N,C)] complexes derived from the well-known 1,8-dimethylaminonaphthyl ligand DAN.68–71 The historical P-chelation assisted C–H activation route pioneered by Shaw 50 years ago remains the most straightfor-ward and general route to prepare [Np(P,C)M] complexes. This shows complete selectivity for the Csp2–H bond at the peri position to phosphorus, even when a methyl group is present next to phosphorus. peri-Halo naphthyl phosphines are readily available. Their P-chelation assisted oxidative addition has become a valuable alternative route to C–H activation. First introduced to demonstrate the feasibility of Csp2–X oxidative addition to a single gold(I) center, it has then been extended to nickel. A third complementary route applied to groups 7–11 metals relies on transmetalation from stable mercury or tin peri-metalated naphthyl phosphines. From a structural viewpoint, the [Np(P,C)] framework is well suited and nicely accommodates metals from groups 7 to 11, as apparent from the P–M and Cperi–M bond lengths, which only slightly deviate from the respective sums of the covalent radii. The naphthyl moiety imparts rigidity, but retains some flex-ibility, by bending the Cperi–P bond toward the metal and out of the naphthalene plane. Reactivity studies on [Np(P,C)M] complexes long remained sparse and isolated, but the robustness and synthetic potential of palladium, platinum and ruthenium complexes were recog-nized early on in several transformations (the Heck reaction, the conjugate addition of aryl boronic acids to electron-deficient alkenes, the transfer hydrogenation of ketones, etc.). Np(P,C)-cyclometalation turned to be particularly fruitful in gold(III) chemistry, where it has opened new reactivity paths (migratory insertion, b-H elimination, and nucleophilic addi-tion to p-allyl) and has enabled many new bonding situations to be authenticated (C–H agostic, p and s-arene, p-allyl, and Schrock-type nucleophilic carbene complexes), resulting ulti-mately in unique catalytic activity in the intermolecular hydro-arylation of alkynes. [Np(P,C)M] complexes have also been shown recently to be key intermediates in the Ru-catalyzed alkylation of the remote C5 position of naphthyl phosphines and Rh-catalyzed arylation of the peri position of naphthyl/ pyrenyl phosphines. Very little is known yet about the photophysical properties of [Np(P,C)M] complexes. Interesting phosphorescence properties This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 | 3565have been occasionally pointed out but further studies are certainly needed to better understand the very influence of Np(P,C)-cyclometalation and develop its use in opto-electronic systems. It is likely that the chemistry of [Np(P,C)M] complexes will keep developing and new facets will be discovered in near future. Although not all transition metals may form stable [Np(P,C)M] complexes, there is certainly room to expand the actual diversity. First-raw metals are certainly worth to consider and explore thoroughly. There is no manganese complex known to date, only one tetranuclear copper(I) cluster and very few complexes with iron, cobalt and nickel. So far, only alkyl and aryl groups have been introduced at phosphorus. The substitution pattern may be varied further using heteroaryl, alkoxy, and amino groups to significantly decrease/increase the electron-density at phosphorus. Other P-containing groups than phosphines may also be incorporated. The rich chemistry displayed by [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes will certainly stimulate research towards highly reactive complexes, basic transforma-tions and catalytic applications with other metals. Being readily accessible, broadly modulable and very robust, the [Np(P,C)M] platform is very attractive and holds much potential. To date, applications have focused essentially on catalysis, but materials science and medicinal chemistry are certainly worth to be considered too. Indeed, [Np(P,C)M] complexes may well com-plement and eventually outperform the commonly used rigid (N,C)-cyclometalated complexes. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare.

The three main synthetic approaches, namely P-chelation assisted C–H activation, oxidative addition and transmetalation, are described and compared. If a naphthyl fra-mework inherently predisposes a phosphorus atom and transition metal to interact, a rigid metallacycle may induce some strain and distortion, as apparent from the survey of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database (77 entries with metals from groups 7 to 11). Generally, the Np(P,C)-cyclometalation imparts high thermal and chemical robustness to the complexes, and a variety of stoichiometric reactions have been reported. In most cases, the metalacyclic structure is retained, but protodecyclometalation and ring-expansion have been sparingly observed. [Np(P,C)M] complexes have also proved to be competent and actually competitive catalysts in several transformations, and they act as key intermediates in some others. In addition, interesting phosphorescence properties have been occasionally pointed out.",

Their interest ranges from fundamental bonding/reactivity aspects to applications in catalysis, materials chemical science, medicine, and others. The easy access, broad structural mod-ularity and versatile coordination properties of phosphines make them very powerful ligands for transition metals. It is thus not surprising that (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes occupy a forefront position.3–6 Here, PCP complexes I with a central benzene ring and two flanking phosphines have become the reference complexes (Chart 1).7 Their pincer structure results in a unique balance of stability/reactivity. The related (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes II featuring a single phosphine side-arm have also been widely investigated. In contrast, the corres-ponding naphthyl-based (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes III, hereafter denoted as [Np(P,C)M], long remained underdeve-loped although they are known for more than 50 years.

        "In the first part, the synthesis of [Np(P,C)M] complexes is presented. The three main synthetic approaches, namely P-chelation assisted C–H activation, oxidative addition and transmetalation, are described and compared. Then, the struc-ture and bonding of [Np(P,C)M] complexes are thoroughly analysed based on crystallographic and computational data. Special attention is given to the distortion/flexibility of a naphthyl spacer and its ability to accommodate a broad range of transition metals, despite its high rigidity. The following section deals with the reactivity of [Np(P,C)M] complexes in stoichiometric reactions and catalytic transformations. The (P,C)-cyclometalated framework is retained in most cases, but not always. Finally, a few photophysical studies performed on [Np(P,C)M] complexes are described.",
        "Np(P,C)-cyclometalated complexes Three main synthetic strategies can be distinguished to access (P,C)-cyclometalated naphthyl complexes, [Np(P,C)M] (Fig. 1). They differ in the nature of pro-ligands and the way the transition metal is introduced. C–H activation, starting from simple 1-naphthyl phosphines, is naturally the most direct and common approach. It is also the oldest one, pioneered by Shaw et al. as early as in 1972. The C–H activation of 1-naphthyl phosphines occurs selectively at the peri position, due to ideal P-chelation (a 5-membered ring with rotation around the P– Cnaphthyl bond as the only degree of freedom). It can be promoted using a basic ligand on the metal or the addition of an exogeneous base/halide scavenger. This route has been used to prepare a broad range of (P,C)-naphthyl complexes with transition metals from groups 7 to 10. Recently, the renewed interest devoted to group 10 and group 11 metals has stimu-lated studies on alternative pathways to access (P,C)-naphthyl complexes based on the oxidative addition of C–X bonds or onthe transmetalation of mercury/tin derivatives. These routes employ prefunctionalized 1-naphthyl phosphines as starting materials, with a halide or a metalloid at the peri position. Naphthalene derivatives with a phosphorus atom bridging the peri positions are also predisposed to give (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes. A few such species have been shown to undergo ring-expansion by the oxidative addition of the strained P–C bond to group 10 metals and gold. These three routes will be successively presented in detail in this section.",
        "1. Via C–H activation With a unique and simple prefunctionalization on the naphtha-lene scaffold (to introduce the P atom), the activation of the peri C–H bond of 1-naphthyl phosphines is the most direct and common synthetic route to access [Np(P,C)M] complexes. This strategy was first described by Shaw in 1972 in a comprehensive study targeting [Np(P,C)Ir(III)] complexes.1 Different cyclometa-lation conditions taking the advantage of P-chelation were reported (Scheme 1). Starting from Ir(III) complex 1 bearing three dimethyl 1-naphthyl phosphines coordinated in a meridional fashion, the first cyclometalation reaction was achieved in a good yield (75%) by thermal activation (124 1C) in methyl glycol. A second C–H activation could be efficiently performed by heating mono-cyclometalated iridium complex 2 with an external base, sodium acetate. Interestingly, the coordination mode of the three phosphorus atoms around the iridium center changed from meridional to facial after this second cyclometalation step. In these two steps, an Ir–H species, formed by b-hydride elimination from the alcoholic solvent, was postulated as a key intermediate. This hydride could then act as an internal base, generating H2 as the by-product. No firm evidence for this mechanism was reported however. Concomitantly, the same strategy was tempted to prepare analogous rhodium complexes. The first electrophilic C–H activation worked well (84% yield). However, no further reactivity was observed in the case of [Np(P,C)Rh(III)] complex 2. An alternative pathway was also described to give bis-(P,C)-cyclometalated complex 3 starting from the iridium(I) precursor [IrCl(cod)]2. After a first C–H3546 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023activation process by oxidative addition to iridium in boiling light petroleum, iridium(III) complex 5 was isolated in a very good yield (86%). 5 evolved quickly under reflux in methyl glycol to give complex 3 with gas evolution, presumably dihy-drogen. Finally, the third metalation process was performed by abstraction of the last chloride at iridium with a scavenger (i.e. AgBF4) to give tris-(P,C)-cyclometalated complex 4.",
        "Two years later, Shaw prepared a family of [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] complexes starting from cis-dichloroplatinum(II) precursor 6 (Scheme 2).2 Electrophilic C–H activation was performed by mixing PtCl2 with 6 to yield bridged platinum(II) dimer 7 after prolonged heating in xylenes (139 1C). For monomeric (P,C)-cyclometalated chloroplatinum(II) complex 8, the addition of sodium acetate was mandatory to obtain a good yield (77%). After halide exchange (chloride to iodide), alkyl and dialkylplatinum(II) complexes 10 and 11 were prepared using methyllithium. Pyrolysis at high temperatures (4195 1C) then afforded the corresponding iodo 12 and methyl (P,C)-cyclometalated 13 complexes with methane evolution.",
        "In these two seminal reports, Shaw thus depicted four different strategies to cyclometalate 1-naphthyl phosphines, including oxidative addition. The preparations of [Np(P,C)M]complexes via C–H activation reported after 1974 are described in the following sections. Although no detailed mechanistic studies have been carried out on the C–H activation process, these contributions have been organized according to the conditions used to promote cyclometalation: – Direct (electrophilic) C–H activation by a metal-halide (or metal-pseudohalide) precursor, – C–H activation in the presence of a mild base (NaOAc, Et3N), bonded to the metal or external, acting in concert with the metal or not, – C–H activation by a metal-alkyl precursor. a. Direct (electrophilic) C–H activation. The first examples described by Shaw involved metal chloride precursors and required quite high temperatures. Using more electrophilic pseudo-halide complexes (perchlorate and trifluoromethane sulfonate) enables operating under milder conditions. Accordingly, Yip described, in the late 2000’s, the synthesis of mono-and bis-(P,C)-cyclometalated complexes with p-extended naphthalene backbones (anthracene and pyrene) (Scheme 3).9,10 Here, pseudo-cationic palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes featuring diphosphine ligands were used as precursors. Cyclometalation proceeded within hoursThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 |3547at room temperature in this case. Of note, double cyclometalations of 9,10-bis-phosphino-anthracene systematically gave a mixture of syn and anti-bis-(P,C)-cyclometalated complexes (with a syn/anti ratio of 4 60/40).",
        "In 2017, Zhu reported the synthesis of two [Np(P,C)Re] complexes starting from Re2(CO)10 (Scheme 4). 11 The exact way the peri C–H bond is activated is unknown but the authors invoked P-chelation assistance prior to intramolecular activation.",
        "b. C–H activation in the presence of a mild base (NaOAc, NEt3). The C–H metalation of 1-naphthyl phosphines assisted by a mild base, most often sodium acetate, is a simple, efficient and general strategy to prepare (P,C)-cyclometalated naphthyl complexes. Here, cyclometalation is based on the propensity of acetate to catch the peri H atom, thus facilitating the formation of the M–Csp2 bond. 12–14Following Shaw’s pioneering contribution, the groups of Chi and Chou jointly reported in 2010 a stepwise preparation of phosphorescent [Np(Ph2P,C)Ir(III)] complexes (see Section IV). 15 First, the bis-N,C-cyclometalated iridium(III) chloride-bridged dimer was splitted by diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphines upon heating at 100 1C for 24 h (Scheme 5). The initially formed complex 24 with two strong field ligands (carbon and phos-phorus) at the trans position to each other could be isomerised3548 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023into more thermodynamically stable complex 25 (within 48 h at 170 1C). Cyclometalation was then achieved in the presence of sodium acetate (5 eq.) at a high temperature (190 1C). In both cases, a mixture of complexes 26 and 27 was obtained. Based on the absence of thermal interconversion between 26 and 27, the authors proposed a stepwise process: the substitution of chlor-ide by acetate at iridium, followed by C–H bond activation/ metalation.",
        "A year later, the same groups described the preparation of a bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complex (Scheme 6).16 The elec-trophilic C–H activation of diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphines by [IrCl3(tht)3] at 196 1C in decalin first afforded the mono-(P,C)-cyclometalated complex [Np(Ph2P,C)IrCl2(tht)2] (83% isolated yield). Following the addition of diphenyl 1-naphthyl phos-phines, the second cyclometalation required the use of sodium acetate (5 equivalents) to give the [Np(Ph2P,C)]2Ir(k 2-OAc) complex.",
        "In 2017, the group of Zhu studied in detail the cyclometala-tion of diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphines by [Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Ir, Rh) in the presence of sodium acetate (Scheme 7).17 The reactions were performed in methanol at room temperature for 4 h. The cyclometalated complex [Np(Ph2P,C)IrCl(Cp*)] 30 was thereby obtained in a good yield (72%) along with a small amount of the corresponding non-cyclometalated iridium dichloride complex 31. The characterization of complex 31 supports a stepwise P-chelation assisted process for cyclometa-lation (an independent experiment actually confirmed theconversion of 31 to 30 over time). By comparison, the C–H bond activation seemed to be faster with rhodium, since the rhodium analogue of 31 was not observed during the reaction. In addition, the authors compared the reactivity of Csp2–H and Csp3–H bonds towards cyclometalation using a 1-naphthyl phosphine featuring a methyl group adjacent to phosphorus. Only the Csp2–H bond activation was observed with both iridium and rhodium. The cyclometalation of bis-1-naphthyl phosphines was then investigated (Scheme 8).18 With [Cp*IrCl2]2, very different out-comes were observed at room temperature depending on the substituent at phosphorus (R = Ph, tBu). Indeed, only P-coordination without cyclometalation was observed for the phenyl phosphine, whereas the tert-butyl phosphine directly afforded the cyclometalated complex [Np(tBu2P,C)IrCl(Cp*)]. Here, C–H activation was probably favoured as it relieved the strain induced by the high steric demand at phosphorus. Upon heating at reflux in methanol, both complexes converted into the corresponding bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, which were also prepared in high yields without heating using sodium acetate. With [Cp*RhCl2]2, no reaction occurred even upon heating, presumably due to lower electrophilicity of rhodium compared to that of iridium, but the addition of sodium acetate readily promoted cyclometalation, whatever the substituent at phosphorus. Yet, double cyclometalation could not be achieved in this case, even using a stronger base such as tBuOK. Zhu also applied the C–H activation route to prepare [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes (Scheme 9).19 Most convenient was to react 1-naphthyl phosphines with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 at room temperature in methanol in the presence of sodium acetate (4 eq.). Alternatively, non-cyclometalated phosphine complexes could be first prepared in dichloromethane without a base, and then stirred over silica gel under air to induceThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 |3549cyclometalation. An analogous complex [Np(Ph2P,C)RuCl(C6Me6)] was prepared soon after by Ishii starting from [(Z6-C6Me6)-RuCl2]2. 20 Given that o-tolyl phosphines were shown to undergo Csp3–H cyclometalation under the same conditions, the competi-tion between Csp2–H and Csp3–H activations was assessed by Zhu.19 Using iridium and rhodium, the 1-naphthyl phosphine featuring a methyl group adjacent to phosphorus was found to react with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2/NaOAc exclusively at the peri Csp2–H site.",
        "Under the NaOAc-assisted conditions, Grabulosa prepared in 2019 a series of [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes from optically pure P-stereogenic phosphines featuring naphthalene (Chart 2), phenanthrene and pyrene scaffolds for applications in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones (see Section III).21 The corresponding (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes were isolated in low yields (4–17%, except 49, 71%) probably due to decomposi-tion during purification by column chromatography. In most cases, they were obtained as diastereoisomeric mixtures (the ruthenium center becomes stereogenic upon cyclometalation). Only in the case of iPr-substituted phosphine, good phosphorus to ruthenium chiral induction was apparently achieved, with the formation of a single diastereoisomer according to 31P NMR spectroscopy.",
        "Base-assisted C–H activation has also been applied to pre-pare (P,C)-cyclometalated naphthyl complexes with group 10 metals. The first examples were reported by Shaw in 1998.22Starting from the tri-1-naphthyl phosphine, a series of pallada-cycles were prepared as a result of monocyclometalation. With Pd(OAc)2, a dimeric acetate-bridged complex was obtained (Scheme 10). Subsequent treatment with acetyl-acetone gave the corresponding mononuclear acac complex [Np(Np2P,C)Pd-(acac)] which can be alternatively prepared by reacting PNp3 with [Pd(acac)2]. The analogous complex [ Np(Np2P,C)Pd(acac)] featuring an hexafluoro acetyl-acetonate co-ligand at palladium was prepared similarly. In 2005, the group of Herrmann applied the same strategy to synthesize palladacycles from the diphenyl 2-methylnaphthyl phosphine.23 Upon treatment with Pd(OAc)2, cyclometalation proceeded readily and efficiently under mild conditions, with complete selectivity for the peri Csp2–H bond. Finally, Vigalok and Vedernikov prepared in 2013 a Pt(II) complex using triethylamine as a base (Scheme 11).24 The naphthyl phosphine featured a methyl group adjacent to phos-phorus and again, complete chemoselectivity for Csp2–H over Csp3–H bond activation was observed. c. C–H activation by a metal-alkyl precursor. As mentioned above, the group of Shaw pointed out in 1974 the ability of metal-alkyl complexes to cyclometalate 1-naphthyl phos-phines, while the corresponding halide precursors remained unreactive.2 [Np(Me2P,C)Pt(II)] complexes were prepared using this way, although the reaction required harsh conditions (195– 200 1C, neat). In 2011, Goldberg reported a similar transforma-tion from the di-tert-butyl 1-naphthyl phosphine and [(m-SMe2)PtMe2]2 (Scheme 12). 25 Here, gas evolution, most likely methane, was observed right after mixing at room temperature. The cyclometalated complex [Np(tBu2P,C)Pt(SMe2)Me] was quickly (5 minutes) and efficiently obtained (89% isolated yield). The presence of a single phosphine per metal and the steric demand of the tBu groups at phosphorus are likely to trigger the C–H activation process via preorganization and/or strain release, which probably explains why the reaction pro-ceeded under very mild conditions in this case.",
        "3550 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023In 2000’s, Klein and Beck extended the approach to first-row metals, namely cobalt and iron (Scheme 13).26 The diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphine was found to react smoothly with tri-methylphosphine Fe(II)Me2 and Co(I)Me precursors to give the corresponding (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes. The release of methane acts as a driving force and at the same time imparts irreversibility to cyclometalation.",
        "Metal-silyl precursors may also be used to cyclometalate 1-naphthyl phosphines, as substantiated by Corriu in 1981 (Scheme 14).27 Under UV irradiation, the di-carbonyl silyl iron complex [CpFe(CO)2SiPh2Me] was found to cleanly react with the P-stereogenic phosphine MePhP(Np). The cyclometalated complex [Np(PhMeP,C)FeCp(CO)] was obtained in 85% yield as a 1 : 1 mixture of diastereomers. The silane HSiPh2Me was concomitantly released (90% yield) and no deuterium incor-poration was observed when the reaction was performed in deuterated benzene, suggesting that the silyl group indeed participated in the C–H activation process, catching the peri H atom. Of note, the authors attempted to prepare an optically active form of the cyclometalated complex starting from the phosphine in a non-racemic mixture, but sadly, phosphorus epimerization was faster than coordination/cyclometalation under UV irradiation.",
        "d. O2-promoted C–H activation. In 2014, the group of Goldberg reported a peculiar route to a dinuclear hydroxy-bridged [Np(P,C)Pd(II)] complex (Scheme 15).28 The di-phosphine Pd(0) complex [(tBu2Np)2Pd] was found to readily react with dioxygen with the concomitant cyclometalation of the peri C–H bond and O–O cleavage. Reaction monitoring at low temperatures enabled an Z2-peroxo palladium complex to be authenticated as a key intermediate. Based on DFTcalculations, the authors proposed a plausible path for the C–H activation, by addition across one of the Pd–O bond with the concomitant release of a phosphine. The resulting Pd–OOH species would then lose an oxygen atom to give the dimeric hydroxy-bridged complex [Np(tBu2P,C)Pd(m-OH)]2.",
        "2. Via oxidative addition In 2002, the group of Mizuta reported an original P(III) peri-bridged naphthalene derivative (Scheme 16). This highly strained structure is prone to ring-expansion, as substantiated by the preparation of a [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] complex.29,30 The phos-phorus lone pair was first masked with a W(CO)5 fragment. Upon treatment with [Pt(PPh3)4], one of the P–C bonds oxida-tively added to platinum and one of the PPh3 co-ligands at platinum were then displaced by CO. Related [Np(P,C)Pd(II)] complexes were then synthesized by the same group using a similar strategy, using [Pd(PPh3)4] as the palladium(0) precursor.31 The phosphorus atom of the strained four-membered phosphacycle was preliminarily oxidized with hydrogen peroxide or elemental sulfur to give the corres-ponding P(V) pro-ligands. Oxidative addition of the strained P–C bond proceeded easily at room temperature to give the desired phosphapalladacycles in high yields (81–86%). Only one triphenylphosphine co-ligand remained coordinated to the palladium center. The complexes adopt dimeric structures with the PQE moiety (E = O, S) in a bridging mode. These results show the possibility to obtain (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes by the insertion of low valent metals into the strained four-This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem.

        "Naphthyl phosphines with halogen at the peri position are readily available from 1,8-dihalogenonaphthalenes.32 They are predisposed to undergo P-chelation assisted oxidative addition, as first demonstrated by our group in 2014 with gold.33 In the context of a lively debate about the feasibility of oxidative addition at gold, we described the straightforward synthesis of (P,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) complexes through the oxida-tive addition of a Csp2–I bond to a single gold(I) center under mild conditions (Scheme 17).33P-chelation assistance was clearly substantiated by the spec-troscopic characterization of the instantaneously formed gold(I) complex, followed by the progressive build-up of the [Np(P,C)Au(III)I2] complex. Kinetic and computational studies shed light on the intramolecular and unimolecular characters of the process involving a three-center transition state. With the corresponding peri-bromo phosphine, oxidative addition could also be successfully achieved upon increasing the reaction temperature to 130 1C (instead of 25 1C for the peri-iodo phosphine, in line with the relative strengths of C–Br and C–Ibonds). However, no reaction was observed with the corres-ponding peri-chloro phosphine, even after several hours at 130 1C in xylene. Calculations confirmed the higher activation barrier for the oxidative addition of the C–Cl bond (DG‡ = 39.7 kcal molNone1, compared to 32.1 kcal molNone1 for C–Br and 21.9 kcal molNone1 for C–I). Furthermore, in this case, the for-mation of the gold(III) complex is uphill in energy (+0.3 kcal molNone1) in contrast to the oxidative additions of the C–I and C–Br bonds (None9.1 and None7.2 kcal molNone1, respectively). Analo-gous [Np(P,C)AuI2] was subsequently prepared using the same approach using iPr and Cy substituents at phosphorus.34,35 We also studied the behaviour of copper in such a process and reacted peri-halo naphthyl phosphines with various Cu(I) complexes (Scheme 18).36,37 P-chelation was found to efficiently assist the oxidative addition of the C–I bond to copper, but the reaction did not stop there. The ensuing copper(III) species spontaneously underwent P–C reductive elimination to yield new peri-bridged phosphonio naphthalene. DFT calculations confirmed the feasibility and easiness of the C–I oxidative addition and P–C reductive elimination (activation barriers of 9.5 and 7.6 kcal molNone1 in DCM, respectively). The formation of the peri-bridged phosphonio naphthalene compound is exer-gonic by 12.3 kcal molNone1. The generality of the reaction was then examined. Replacing the iPr substituents at phosphorus either by a diamino (iPr)NCH2CH2N( iPr) moiety or Ph groups led to similar results. The halogen atom at the peri position was then varied, demon-strating that P-chelation enables copper to also activate C–Br and C–Cl bonds. Finally, efficient catalytic conditions were established to obtain peri-bridged naphthyl-phosphonium using only 1–5 mol% of copper(I) starting from peri iodo-or bromo-naphthyl phosphines (Scheme 19).383552 | Chem.

Given the rarity of intermole-cular (not chelation-assisted) oxidative additions to gold, we wondered about the possibility to insert gold into the P–C bond and to access thereby [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes. This proved indeed feasible, although it required relatively harsh conditions (Scheme 20).",
        "In 2021, Beckmann extended the P-chelation strategy and prepared [AcNp(Ph2P,C)Ni(II)] complexes (AcNp refers to ace-naphthyl) via the oxidative addition of C–X bonds (X = F, Cl,Br, and I) peri to phosphorus (Scheme 21).39 Once again, halide was observed to have a major impact on the rate of the C–X bond activation. Indeed, the oxidative addition of the C–I bond proceeded at –78 1C and that of the C–Br/C–Cl bonds at room temperature, while heating at 50 1C was required for the C–F bond. Highly air-sensitive dinuclear complexes were obtained. Addition of THF or MeCN subsequently gave rise to mono-nuclear complexes for X = Cl, Br, and I but not for X = F.",
        "3. Via transmetalation Recently, Beckmann has developed a complementary transme-talation route (Scheme 22). Accordingly, the [AcNp(Ph2P,C)] group was transferred from mercury or tin to groups 9–11 transition metals (Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, and Au). Transmetalation from gallium to copper was also observed once, leading to a Cu cluster.40 The mercury(II)/tin(IV) derivatives are readily prepared from the corresponding peri-bromo acenaphthyl phosphine. They are non-reductive and bench stable. A transmetalation/redox process was first reported.41 The [AcNp(Ph2P,C)]2Hg(II) derivative slowly reacted with (tht)AuCl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) to give the cationic cis-[AcNp(Ph2P,C)]2Au + complex along with mercury(0). Note that the same gold(III) complex was obtained later on in the mixture with its trans isomer (cis/trans ratio = 15 : 85) upon the reaction of the [AcNp(Ph2P,C)Sn nBu3] derivative with half an equivalent of (tht)AuCl3. 42 The factors controlling the cis/trans stereochem-istry of gold(III) complexes remain unknown. When reacted with an excess of (tht)AuCl3, the tin derivative afforded the neutral [AcNp(Ph2P,C)AuCl2] complex (90% yield). This mononuclear gold(III) species could also be prepared in two steps, reacting the tin derivative with one equivalent of the gold(I) precursor (tht)AuCl, and oxidizing the ensuing (P,C)-bridged gold(I) dinuclear complex with PhICl2. Besides gold(III) complexes, the transmetalation/redox strategy was applied to the preparation of bis-(P,C)-cyclo-metalated rhodium(III) and platinum(IV) complexes by reactingThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem.

        "II. Structure and bonding analyses A CCDC database search reveals 77 X-ray structures of (P,C)-naphthyl cyclometalated complexes. The key geometric features were collected (see the ESI,† Table S1) so as to analyse the geometric constraints and distortions. These data have been sorted according to the metal: from group 7 (2 Re complexes) to group 8 (6 Fe and 8 Ru complexes), group 9 (2 Co, 1 Rh and 6 Ir complexes), group 10 (4 Ni, 13 Pd and 13 Pt complexes), and group 11 (22 Au complexes).",
        "First, looking at the bond distances, the P–M and M–Cperi distances were compared with the sum of the corresponding covalent radii,44 referring to the r parameters (Charts 3a and b). None of the structurally characterized complex shows a r(P–M) factor of above 1.00. About 20% of the structures, mainly Au complexes, possess a r(P–M) factor of 0.95–1.00. All the other complexes fall in the 0.90 None 0.05 range. The (P,C)-naphthyl backbone is thus very suited and very well accommodate allmetals. It does not induce significant constraint on the P–M and C–M bond lengths. This feature is even more apparent from the r(M–Cperi) values that marginally deviate from 1.00 (87% fall in the 1.00 None 0.05 range). For bond angles, the bite angle (P–M–Cperi) varies very little, regardless of the transition metal and complex, with 88% of the registered structures displaying a value in between 82 and 851 (Chart 4a). Some in-plane distortions of the naphthalene scaf-fold are however observed, as apparent from the Cbridge–Cperi–M and P–Cperi–Cbridge bay angles (Charts 4b and c). While the Cbridge–Cperi–M bay angle does not deviate much from the ideal 1201 value (by 21 at most), the P–Cperi–Cbridge bay angle is systematically found below 1201, with 85% of the structures falling in the range of 110–1151. The ability of the (P,C)-naphthyl framework to accommodate different metals thus seems to mainly arise from the P atom and the Cperi–P bond. Out-of-plane distortions were also examined through the deviations of the P and M atoms at peri positions from the naphthalene plane (tilt angles a/a0, Charts 5a and b). In general, only minor deviations are observed. No correlation was found between the variations of a,a0 and r(P–M) (Charts S1 and S2, ESI†). The largest deviations concern the P atom (with out-of-3554 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023plane distortions a up to 101 and 94% of the structures in the 4– 101 range) while the metal usually remains close to the naphthalene plane (71% of the structures display a0 values between 1 and 51). It is to note that even if the deviations are small, the P and M atoms are systematically tilted in opposite directions (up and down the naphthalene plane), probably to minimize steric repulsions between the substituents at phos-phorus and the co-ligands at M.",
        "The bonding situation within [Np(P,C)M] complexes has been occasionally assessed by computational means. Mebs, Hupf and Beckmann performed atom-in-molecules, electron localizability indicators and non-covalent interaction analyses on rhodium, nickel, palladium, platinum and gold complexes.39,42,43 In all cases, the P–M and C–M bonds were found to be of polar covalent nature. The covalent and ionic contributions are slightly lower in the P–M bonds than in the C–M bonds.",

Applications of [Np(P,C)M] cyclometalated complexes: stoichiometric reactivity and catalytic transformations In this section, the stoichiometric reactivity and catalytic appli-cation of cyclometalated naphthyl (P,C) complexes will be presented.

[Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes In the previous section, we presented the easy access to cyclometalated (P,C)-Au(III) complexes via chelate-assisted oxi-dative addition of the C–X bond to gold(I). The rigid nature of the (P,C) naphthyl ligand and its strong coordination to gold gives highly stable derivatives and allows us to explore the reactivity of gold(III) complexes.",
        "Most of the elementary steps (migratory insertion, b-H elimination, etc.) known with isoelectronic metals (nickel(II), palladium(II) and platinum(II)) were not described with gold(III) complexes a decade ago. In this section, we present our work consisting of meticulous experimental and theoretical studies aiming to demonstrate the ability of gold(III) to efficiently undergo these elementary transformations.",
        "For this purpose, we took advantage of the selective mod-ulation of cyclometalated (P,C)-AuI2 giving easy access to P;Cð Þ-AuR02 complexes by the reaction with the corresponding Grignard reagent (Scheme 25).34,45,46 In the presence of one equivalent of an organometallic reactant, the organic fragment sits trans to the phosphorus as apparent from NMR ( JC–P Z 100 Hz for trans isomer compared to 5.7 Hz for methyl at the cis position in Np(P,C)-AuMe2) and in line with trans effects.",
        "a. Migratory insertion of alkenes in Au(III)–C bonds. In 2015, we took advantage of the robustness of the [Np(P,C)AuMe2] complex to demonstrate the feasibility of the migratory insertion of alkenes into Au(III)–C bonds (Scheme 26).34 The 3-coordinated cationic gold(III) complex was generated by methyl abstraction with tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane. Due to its high electrophilicity, it proved highly unstable and spontaneously grasped a pentafluorophenyl group from the borate counter-anion to give the neutral [Np(P,C)AuMe(C6F5)] complex (obtained as a mixture of cis/trans isomers). The 3-coordinated cationic gold(III) complex could nevertheless be trapped before to rearrange, as substantiated with 2,6-lutidine.",
        "The reaction of [Np(P,C)AuMe2] with B(C6F5)3 was then carried out in the presence of alkenes with the aim to achieve migratory insertion. Using ethylene or styrene, no sign of alkene incorporation was observed, but with norbornene (nbe), a strained and more reactive alkene, double insertion into the Au(III)–Me bond occurred (Scheme 27). The ensuinggold(III) complex was isolated and fully characterized (HRMS, NMR spectroscopy, and XRD) after trapping with tetrabutylam-monium chloride (or pyridine). Syn additions across the CQC double bond of nbe attested unequivocally to the inner-sphere migratory addition process (as opposed to the usual outer-sphere addition anti to gold). The mechanism of this reaction was thoroughly investigated by computational and experimental means (Scheme 28).34,47 Accordingly, it classically involves coordination–insertion of alkene and because of the electronic dissymmetry of the cyclometalated (P,C) ligand, the first insertion was found slightly more demanding energetically than the second one (activation barriers of 18.7 and 15.7 kcal molNone1, respectively), in line with the observation of double insertion. Low-temperature monitoring by NMR spectroscopy enabled detecting two key intermediates: the first p-alkene complex and the double inser-tion product before trapping with chloride. The latter species represents the first example of an agostic complex with gold. Coordination of the g C–H bond of the bis-norbornyl moiety to3556 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023gold was apparent from the reduced 1JCH coupling (97 Hz) as well as NBO and AIM analyses.48We then envisioned to extend the migratory insertion of alkenes to gold(III) aryl complexes, with the idea to access and characterize p-arene gold(III) complexes (Scheme 29).49,50 Such species were proposed as the initial stage of the C–H activation of arenes at gold(III). The [Np(P,C)Au(Ph)I] complex was reacted with AgSbF6 in the presence of norbornene. Here, mono-insertion took place rapidly and cleanly to give a p-arene gold(III) complex. According to NMR spectroscopy, XRD analysis (of the p-methoxy derivative) and DFT calculations, the arene moiety is Z2-coordinated to gold. The reaction profile of nbe insertion into the Au(III)–Ph bond was analysed by DFT calcula-tions. Coordination–insertion was found to be facile (with an even lower activation barrier than that for the Au(III)–Me complex, 10.7 vs. 18.7 kcal molNone1). Then, cis/trans isomerization proceeds readily to give the p-arene gold(III) complex obtained. Of note, the auration of p-coordinated arene could be triggered easily by adding a base such as the proton sponge. This demonstrates the relevance of such p-arene complexes to the electrophilic metalation of arenes at gold(III).",
        "b. b-Hydride elimination. As pointed out by Köppel and Hashmi in 2013, b-hydride elimination is intrinsically highly disfavoured in gold(I) alkyl complexes. With a d8 configuration, gold(III) alkyl complexes are a priori more prone to b-H elimina-tion, although direct experimental evidence was long lacking. Taking advantage of the stability of [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes, we carried out in 2016 a comprehensive study on 3-coordinated cationic gold(III) n-alkyl complexes (Scheme 30).45 The target compounds (nPr and nBu) were easily generated by reacting the corresponding neutral iodide complexes with AgNTf2 at –90 1C, and their reactivity was monitored by variable-temperature NMR spectroscopy. Accordingly, above 0 1C, the n-propyl complex was found to transform into the known cationic bis-cyclometalated species with the concomitant release of propy-lene as a result of b-hydride elimination (propane is also formed by a bimolecular pathway).",
        "A similar process was observed from the corresponding n-butyl gold(III) complex, with the release of cis and trans 2-butenes, as well as butane (Scheme 31). The formation of internal alkenes indicates that the initially generated 1-butene rapidly re-inserts into the Au(III)–H bond resulting in a chain walking process. Computational studies have estimated the activation barriers for such b-H eliminations to 8–14 kcal molNone1 (compared to o2 kcal molNone1 for the olefin re-insertion into the Au(III)–H bond). In addition, reacting the corresponding [Np(P,C)Au(III)] methyl complex with ethylene (7 bars) at 50 1C afforded a mixture of propene and butenes. Here, the slow insertion of ethylene into the Au(III)–Me bond is followed by rapid b-H elimination. A reaction sequence involving coordination–insertion and b-hydride elimination was also observed by reacting the [Np(P,C)Au(III)Ph] complex with ethylene (Scheme 32).49 In this case, styrene re-insertion is very facile, much more than its dissociation. As a result, the reaction gives a gold(III) styryl complex stabilized by p-arene coordination. c. p-Allyl gold(III) complexes. While palladium(II) p-allyl complexes are iconic in organometallic chemistry, analogous gold(III) species remained elusive until recently. In 2020, we took advantage of the rigid and robust [Np(P,C)Au(III)] platform to prepare and study p-allyl gold(III) complexes (Scheme 33).46 They were readily prepared from the corresponding neutral s-allyl precursors, by iodide abstraction with AgSbF6. The thorough analysis of the bonding situation by NMR spectro-scopy, XRD and DFT calculations revealed the static and highly symmetric Z3-coordination of the p-allyl moiety to gold. Of note, the related (N,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) p-allyl complexes prepared simultaneously and independently by Tilset proved to adopt highly fluxional and unsymmetric s + p structures instead.51 To draw parallel with palladium(II) complexes, we reacted the [Np(P,C)Au(III)] p-allyl complexes with b-dicarbonyl carbanions. The corresponding C–C coupling products were obtained in good to excellent yields, as the result of nucleo-philic addition to the p-coordinated allyl moieties. A meticulous mechanistic study combining in situ NMR mon-itoring at low temperatures and DFT calculations revealed a complex and rich picture for this apparently simple transforma-tion (Scheme 34).35 If the C-allylation product is readily obtained whatever the p-allyl substitution (R = H, Me) and b-dicarbonyl nucleophile (R0 = OEt, Ph), nucleophilic attack can occur initially at either the terminal or the central positions of p-allyl, as well as at the metal itself. Reactive intermediates resulting from these 3 competitive paths were actually all authenticated spectroscopically and/or crystallographically. For palladium(II) p-allyl complexes, the regioselectivity of the nucleophilic addition is under orbital rather than charge control. The close inspection of the molecular orbital diagram for [Np(P,C)Au(III)] p-allyl complexes showed the presence of three vacant orbitals with major contributions of gold and the terminal/central positions of p-allyl within a small energy gap. This explains why nucleophilic attacks to the 3 sites are intrinsically in competition. Of note, p-allyl gold(III) complexes were amenable to catalytic allylation. Using a P^N hemilabile ligand, we could cross-This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 |3557couple allyl acetates and alcohols with indoles with complete selectivity for the branched C3-allylated products.52d. Hydroarylation of alkynes catalysed by [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes. The ability of [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes to engage in migratory-insertion, C–H activation and b-H elimination prompted us to consider their possible use as catalysts in the intermolecular hydroarylation of alkynes.53 This transforma-tion, pioneered by Fujiwara with platinum and palladiumcomplexes,54,55 gives straightforward access to styrene deriva-tives and represents an attractive alternative to the Heck coupling, using aryl-H instead of aryl-X substrates. This formal addition of aryl-H bonds to alkynes prevents the pre-functionalization of the arene substrate. (P,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) complexes 110 and 111 with labile trifluoroacetate OAcF co-ligands were readily prepared. Using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as a co-solvent facilitates OAcF dissociation and enables operating under silver-free conditions. Using the addition of 1,3,6-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) to diphenylacetylene (DPA) as the test reaction, the (P,C)-cyclometalated gold(III) complexes proved extremely active, while the related (N,C)-cyclometalated complexes showed no or low activity (Scheme 35). Poor results3558 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023were also observed with a (P,C,P) gold(III) complex as well as a non-cyclometalated gold(I) complex. The [Np(P,C)Au(III)] com-plexes are thus unique to show high robustness and activity in this transformation. Substituting the phosphorus atom by a Ph instead of an iPr group reduces the steric hindrance and increases the electrophilicity of the gold(III) center, resulting in enhanced activity. Ultimately, the coupling of TMB and DPA could be achieved in a 98% yield at 0.1 mol% loading within 3 h.",
        "[Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes showed high activity with a rather broad scope of substrates (Chart 6). The reaction works efficiently with internal alkynes featuring aryl, alkyl, ester and keto substituents, as well as terminal alkynes. Other electron-rich arenes than TMB can also be used, including dialkoxy-benzenes, durene and mesitylene. In all cases, hydroarylation is fully regioselective, and it is generally fully stereoselective, affording the anti-addition product.",
        "A priori, two paths are conceivable to account for such Au(III)-catalyzed arene/alkyne coupling (Scheme 36). One involves thep-coordination of the alkyne to gold yielding 119, the outer-sphere nucleophilic addition of the arene and finally proto-deauration. The other one starts by the C–H activation of the arene affording 117, followed by the migratory insertion of the alkyne and finally protodeauration. The outer-sphere path was initially inferred indirectly, based on the observed formation of the anti-addition products. A thorough mechanistic study was then performed,56 to track reactive intermediates and better understand the factors at play. Accordingly, using B(C6F5)3 as the co-catalyst instead of TFA as the co-solvent enabled us to characterize by low temperature NMR spectroscopy the cationic complex [Np(P,C)Au(OAcF)]+, the active species easily shifting from k2 to k1-OAcF coordination, and its TMB adductThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem.

The key p-alkyne complex was also generated and characterized in the gas phase by mass spectrometry using ion-molecule collision techniques. The energy profiles for the coupling of TMB/DPA were also analysed computationally and the outer-sphere path was found to be much less demanding energetically than the inner-sphere mechanism.",
        "e. A Schrock-type nucleophilic Au(III) carbene complex. In contrast with electrophilic Fischer-type gold(I) carbene com-plexes, which are now relatively well-established and under-stood species, gold(III) complexes with a reactive carbene moiety were elusive until recently. In 2017, the groups of Mézailles and Bourissou combined a geminal dianion stabilized by electron-withdrawing PV substituents with a [Np(P,C)Au(III)]I2 complex to prepare an original gold(III) carbene complex (Scheme 37).57 The gold center is in square-planar environment, as expected for gold(III), and the carbene center is its trigonal planar geometry. One of the P(QS)Ph2 side-arm is coordinated to gold, and the other remains pendant. Variable-temperature 31P NMR indicated a dynamic situation, with the rapid exchange of the two P(QS)Ph2 moieties at room temperature. The 13C NMR signal for the carbene center was found at d 18.2 ppm, very much shielded compared to those of electro-philic cationic Au(I) carbene complexes (d from 200 to 321 ppm), indicating a completely different bonding situation and an electron-rich carbene center. Consistently, DFT calcula-tions revealed a high energy HOMO centered at the carbene center. The nucleophilic, Schrock-type character of the carbene center was actually substantiated experimentally by Wittig-type reactions with phenylisothiocyanate and CS2.",
        "2. [Np(P,C)Pd(II)] complexes In 1998, Shaw demonstrated the high catalytic activity and robustness of [Np(P,C)Pd] acetate and acetylacetonate com-plexes 128 and 129 in the Heck reaction (Scheme 38).22 The coupling of iodobenzene and styrene could be achieved at extremely low catalytic loadings (down to 0.0001 mol%) under forcing conditions (up to 13 days at 95 1C) to reach TON as high as 1 120 000. Of note, related cyclometalated complexes derived from benzyl phosphines led to significant lower TON (900 at best). A few years later, Herrmann extended this study to bromo-and chloro-arenes, working at 130 1C and 0.1 mol% catalyst loading.23 Under these conditions, the Heck coupling products could be obtained in high yields from bromo-arenes (with TON up to 1,000) but not from chloro-arenes (29% at best). With these more challenging substrates, the [Bn(P,C)Pd] complexes perform best, with TON values up to 329 000 achieved from bromo-arenes. Conversely, Hou obtained good results with the rigid (P,C)-naphthyl ligand in the intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of bicyclic alkenes with terminal ynones affording polysubstituted furans.58 An exhaustive catalyst screening was conducted, from simple commercially available Pd compounds to (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes derived from binaphthyl, biphenyl, benzyl and naphthyl phosphines. Good yields (460%) were only obtained when using [Np(P,C)Pd] complexes. Recently, Yamamoto applied 9-(diphenylphosphino)anthra-cene-based phosphapalladacycles as catalysts for the conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to electron-deficient alkenes (Scheme 39).59 In situ tests using Pd(OAc)2 and phosphines showed the higher performance of the anthracenyl phosphine (95% yield in coupling product from phenylboronic acid and PhCHQCHC(QO)Ph) over the corresponding naphthyl phos-phine (Ph2PNp, 53%) and triphenylphosphine (o5%). Using the preformed [Ant(P,C)Pd] complex with P(OEt)3 as the co-ligand, the catalytic loading could be decreased to 0.2–0.5 mol% keeping high reactivity over a large substrate scope.",
        "3. [Np(P,C)Pt(II/IV)] complexes In 2011, Goldberg reported the C–H activation of benzene upon thermolysis (100 1C) of a cyclometalated [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] methyl complex in C6D6 (Scheme 40). 25 Methane was identified as the co-product (with CH3D as the major isotopomer) and the addition of an excess of SMe2 was found to inhibit the C–H activation. The authors thus proposed a mechanism involving the displacement of SMe2 by benzene-D6 at platinum, followed by the oxidative addition of a C–D bond/reductive elimination of CH3D or a s-bond metathesis process. In the context of the electrophilic fluorination of arenes with high valent transition metals, Vigalok and Verdernikov investi-gated the oxidation of [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] aryl complexes with XeF2 (Scheme 41).24 The ensuing platinum(IV) complexes showed moderate stability and evolved at 20–60 1C via an 1,3-aryl migration from the platinum center to the b-carbon of the naphthyl fragment to yield (P,C,C)Pt(II) pincer complexes.",

Finally, deprotonation of the naphthyl ring would restore the aromatic naphthalene system.",

[Np(P,C)Fe(II)] complexes The [Np(P,C)Fe(II)] methyl complex was found by Beck and Sun to be unstable thermally (Scheme 42).60 The iron center is in octahedral geometry with the Me group at the cis position to the carbon atom of the (P,C)-cyclometalated ligand. Upon gentle heating (40 1C, 4 h), reductive elimination took place to give the corresponding C-methylated naphthyl diphenylphosphine.",
        "Nonetheless, some stoichiometric reactions with the retention of the cyclometalated Np(P,C) framework were also reported. With carbon monoxide, the ligand exchange of one trimethyl-phosphine co-ligand proceeded smoothly at room temperature, while C–H activation occurred with terminal alkynes to give the corresponding acetylide complexes with release of methane.",

[Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes were applied to the catalytic reduction of ketones by transfer hydrogenation with isopropanol. In 2007, Zhu compared the catalytic activities of various p-cymene phosphine complexes under similar conditions: 0.5 mol% catalyst loading, 82 1C (boiling iPrOH), 48 h, KOH (20 eq.) (Scheme 43).19 Whatever the substituent at phosphorus (Ph or iPr), the [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complex showed lower activity (70–90% yields for the reduction of benzophenone) compared to the non-cyclometalated complex (498% yield) and the benzyl cyclometalated complex (96% yield). However, a significant increase in yields was observed upon introducing a methyl group at the o-position of phosphorus of the [Np(iPr2P,C)Ru] complex (from 70 to 98%).",
        "Two years later, Grabulosa envisioned to develop an asym-metric version by chirality transfer from a P-stereogenic center to the ruthenium center (Scheme 44).21 Starting from homo-chiral naphthyl phosphines, the cyclometalation step pro-ceeded with disappointingly low diastereoselectivity (d.r. = 1 : 2.4 for R = Me and d.r. = 1 : 1.6 for R = MeO). Only the iPr-substituted phosphine induced full control of the ruthenium chiral center, but unfortunately, the cyclometalated complex was formed in a very low yield (15%). Evaluation of these [Np(P,C)Ru(II)] complexes in asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone reveals very low, if any, enantioselectivity(ee o 5%). Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that cyclome-talation of the naphthyl phosphinite ligand (R = OMe) resulted in a noticeable increase of the catalytic activity (from 45% yield in reduction product after 3 h with the non-cyclometalated complex, to 99% yield with the cyclometalated complex).",
        "6. Miscellaneous examples involving M–C cleavage [Np(P,C)M] metalacycles are very robust and in all the previously described reactions and catalyses, they remain intact through-out the transformations. However, M–C bond cleavage was found to occur in a few cases, presented hereafter. a. [Np(P,C)Re] complexes. In 2017, the group of Zhu inves-tigated the decyclometalation of [Np(P,C)Re] complexes11 inspired by the work of Lu on homologous N,C-cyclometalated complexes.61 The cleavage of the Re–C bond was achieved under UV irradiation at room temperature in chloroform or bromoform to yield the corresponding rhenium halide com-plexes. Protodecyclometalation was also reported with trifluor-oacetic acid under photolytic conditions at room temperature. The photolysis of various (P,C)Re cyclometalated complexes in the presence of aryl halides in benzene was then investigated (Scheme 45). The corresponding biphenyl products were thereby obtained in high yields (80–98%) and short reaction times (few hours) along with the decyclometalated Re com-plexes (as a result of formal HX trapping). Taking advantage of the facile cyclometalation of naphthyl phosphines at rhenium in the presence of a base, the cross-coupling of 4-bromoanisole and benzene (used as the solvent) was then possible under catalytic conditions, in the presence of 1 equivalent of sodium hydroxide (Scheme 46). Of note, the ancillary Np(P,C) ligand was found to outperform its more flexible Csp3 variant (59 vs. 26% yield) and replacing the Ph groups at phosphorus for iPr led to an increase in stability of the rhenium catalyst (no free ligand observed with iPr) and thus a better yield in the coupling product (68%). b. [Np(P,C)Ru] and [Np(P,C)Rh] complexes. In the course of their work on the insertion/remote rearrangement of internal3562 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023alkynes in ruthenium complexes, the group of Ishii reported a rare example of P–C reductive elimination at ruthenium (Scheme 50).20 When exposed to an halide abstractor and an internal alkyne, the [Np(P,C)Ru] complex undergoes the 1,2-insertion of the alkyne (R = alkyl or aryl) in the Ru–C bond followed by P–C reductive elimination to yield sandwich complex 146. This mechanism was supported by the isolation of intermediate 147 resulting from the 1,2-insertion of diphe-nylacetylene in the presence of NaBArF4 at room temperature. Heating at 70 1C for 24 hours allows the P–C reductive elimina-tion to take place. Phosphalenium salts can then be released using oxidants (I2 and CuCl2) or CO. 62Recently, Ishii synthesized the analogous alkenyl rhodium(III) complex coordinated with pentamethylcyclopenta-dienyl (Cp*) by the 1,2-insertion of diphenylacetylene in the presence of NaBArF4 (Scheme 51). 63 An addition of 1.0 equiva-lent of di-p-tolylacetylene to this complex results in an equili-brium between the two corresponding alkenylrhodium complexes with a 43 : 57 ratio. The authors proposed that an alkyne exchange occurs via b-carbon elimination, for which the activation barrier was estimated computationally to be acces-sible (15.6 kcal molNone1). This represents one of the rare examples of b-carbon elimination from an alkenyl complex (i.e. the reverse process of alkyne insertion).",
        "Recently, Zeng reported an original Ru-catalyzed alkylation of naphthyl phosphines occurring selectively on the remote C5 position (Scheme 47).64 The transformation proceeds under relative mild conditions (50–80 1C) with bromo-alkanes as alkylating reagents. It takes advantage of the facile and rever-sible formation of [Np(P,C)Ru] complexes by phosphine-directed cyclometalation/protodemetalation. Bromo alkanes are proposed to oxidize the ruthenium center via a single-electron transfer (SET), the alkylation would then occur by radical electrophilic substitution on the naphthyl ring. The high C5-regioselectivity (C5/others 420/1) is tentatively assigned to the inductive effect of the Np(P,C)Ru metallacycle.",
        "In 2018, Yu and Che described jointly the Rh-catalyzed peri arylation of naphthyl phosphines (Scheme 48).65 Using 2.5 mol% of [Rh(cod)Cl]2 and 3 equivalents of tBuOLi as a base, naphthyl phosphines could be efficiently coupled with bromo-arenes (within 24 h at 110 1C) as well as chloro-arenes (within 24 h at 150 1C) in good to high yields. The reaction is fully selective for peri arylation and works with bromo/chloro hetero-arenes as well. Mechanistic studies by mass spectrometry suggest a Rh(I)/Rh(III) catalytic cycle. The bis-phosphine complex [Np(P,C)Rh(PPh2Np)] was proposed to be the active species. Very recently, Hierso and Roger extended this methodology to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular 1-pyrenyl diphenylphosphine (Scheme 49).66 The reaction works well with a large scope of bromo-arenes substituted by electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, as well as bromo-heteroarenes. It is fully selective for the arylation of the position peri to phosphorus, and is also applied to phenanthryl and fluoranthenyl phosphines. The [Rh(I)(cod)2]BF4 and [Rh(Cp*)Cl2]2 complexes can be used and gave similar results. (P,C)-cyclometalated Rh(III) complexes were prepared and their activities were evaluated. The neutral species gave poor results and was assumed to be a deactivated out-of-cycle resting state, while the di-phosphine cationic complex showed high catalytic activity.",
        "IV. Luminescence properties and optoelectronic applications of [Np(P,C)M] complexes 1. [Np(P,C)Pt(II)] complexes In 2009, Yip reported an interesting study on (P,C)-cyclometalated platinum complexes derived from pyrenes.10This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 |3563The fluorescence properties of pyrene derivatives are well-known and widely used, while phosphorescence is usually very weak. Phosphorus substitution and subsequent cyclometala-tion of the peri C–H bond were envisioned as a mean to introduce Pt on the pyrene ring and benefit from the internal heavy-atom effect to enhance phosphorescence. Accordingly, the mono and dimetallic platinum complexes 18 and 20 showed phosphorescence at lem 611–627 nm in oxygen-free acetonitrile solution at room temperature, with quantum yields of 0.44–1.5% and lifetimes of 31.3–63.7 ms (Fig. 2). The heavy-atom effect of Pt was supported by the very weak phosphores-cence of the related Pd dinuclear complex under the same conditions (lem 650 nm, quantum yields o 0.001%). Cyclome-talation is beneficial, as apparent from comparison with the corresponding metalated platinum(II) complex lacking (P,C)-cyclometalation.67 The related complexes with dangling (non-cyclometalated) Pt centers showed very weak phosphorescence if any.",
        "Note that the same authors performed a similar photophy-sical study on analogous anthracene-derived complexes two years before.9 The bis-cyclometalated complexes were found to emit at lem B 460–510 nm in the dichloromethane solution at room temperature, with quantum yields of 1–6% and short half-lifetimes o2 ns (Fig. 3). Only weak fluorescence was observed in this case, with no apparent enhancement of phosphorescence due to the heavy-atom effect. Comparison of the syn and anti-isomers revealed little changes, while the corresponding mono-cyclometalated complex showed weakerfluorescence (0.16% quantum yield) with a too-short lifetime to be measured.",
        "2. [Np(P,C)Ir(III)] complexes Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes such as [(phenyl-pyridyl)3Ir] are strong phosphorescent emitters of interest for optical devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Varying the ligands at iridium offers a simple means to modulate and eventually improve the stability and photophy-sical properties of the complexes. In this regard, Chi and Chou jointly studied in 2010 heteroleptic complexes combining two C^N and one P^C cyclometalated ligands (Fig. 4).15 Attempts to3564 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry2023prepare analogous complexes from benzyldiphenylphosphine failed, preventing the authors to assess the influence of the naphthyl ring on the luminescence properties. Whatsoever, complexes 26 and 27 proved robust (as long as the N^C ligand is equipped with a fluorine atom) and phosphorescent in oxygen-free dichloromethane solution at room temperature with lem of 530–650 nm and quantum yields from 1.6 to 100%. Significantly higher quantum yields were systematically observed for the complexes in which the two nitrogen atoms occupy cis positions. The impact of the N^C cyclometalated ligand at iridium was thoroughly examined. Thanks to time-dependent DFT calculations, the emission transitions were shown to involve MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) and LLCT (ligand-to-ligand charge transfer) or MLCT and ILCT (intra-ligand charge transfer), depending on the N^C ligand. In particular, the (P,C)-naphthyl ligand was proposed to act as the CT acceptor when iridium is ligated by the phenyl-pyridine ligand. Of note, the proof of the feasibility of incorporating such complexes in devices was substantiated. Orange-red emit-ting OLEDs with decent quantum efficiencies (up to 12.5% at 500 cd mNone2 brightness) were prepared.",
        "In a following study, the same authors further extended the structural diversity of iridium(III) emitters.16 Complexes with one N^N azolate ligand and two P^C-cyclometalated ligands derived from diphenyl 1-naphthyl phosphine (or its isoquino-line analog) were shown to also display phosphorescence (with lem of 530–640 nm and quantum yields from 11 to 100%) (Fig. 5).",
        "Conclusions As shown in this review, (P,C)-cyclometalated complexes derived from naphthyl phosphines have been discovered early on but long remained neglected. They have however attracted growing interest recently and been shown to display rich chemistry and open interesting perspectives. The chemistry of the [Np(P,C)] complexes is now much more developed than that of the related [Np(N,C)] complexes derived from the well-known 1,8-dimethylaminonaphthyl ligand DAN.68–71The historical P-chelation assisted C–H activation route pioneered by Shaw 50 years ago remains the most straightfor-ward and general route to prepare [Np(P,C)M] complexes. This shows complete selectivity for the Csp2–H bond at the peri position to phosphorus, even when a methyl group is present next to phosphorus. peri-Halo naphthyl phosphines are readily available. Their P-chelation assisted oxidative addition has become a valuable alternative route to C–H activation. First introduced to demonstrate the feasibility of Csp2–X oxidative addition to a single gold(I) center, it has then been extended to nickel. A third complementary route applied to groups 7–11 metals relies on transmetalation from stable mercury or tin peri-metalated naphthyl phosphines. From a structural viewpoint, the [Np(P,C)] framework is well suited and nicely accommodates metals from groups 7 to 11, as apparent from the P–M and Cperi–M bond lengths, which only slightly deviate from the respective sums of the covalent radii. The naphthyl moiety imparts rigidity, but retains some flex-ibility, by bending the Cperi–P bond toward the metal and out of the naphthalene plane. Reactivity studies on [Np(P,C)M] complexes long remained sparse and isolated, but the robustness and synthetic potential of palladium, platinum and ruthenium complexes were recog-nized early on in several transformations (the Heck reaction, the conjugate addition of aryl boronic acids to electron-deficient alkenes, the transfer hydrogenation of ketones, etc.). Np(P,C)-cyclometalation turned to be particularly fruitful in gold(III) chemistry, where it has opened new reactivity paths (migratory insertion, b-H elimination, and nucleophilic addi-tion to p-allyl) and has enabled many new bonding situations to be authenticated (C–H agostic, p and s-arene, p-allyl, and Schrock-type nucleophilic carbene complexes), resulting ulti-mately in unique catalytic activity in the intermolecular hydro-arylation of alkynes. [Np(P,C)M] complexes have also been shown recently to be key intermediates in the Ru-catalyzed alkylation of the remote C5 position of naphthyl phosphines and Rh-catalyzed arylation of the peri position of naphthyl/ pyrenyl phosphines. Very little is known yet about the photophysical properties of [Np(P,C)M] complexes. Interesting phosphorescence propertiesThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023Chem. Soc. Rev., 2023, 52, 3543–3566 |3565have been occasionally pointed out but further studies are certainly needed to better understand the very influence of Np(P,C)-cyclometalation and develop its use in opto-electronic systems.",
        "It is likely that the chemistry of [Np(P,C)M] complexes will keep developing and new facets will be discovered in near future. Although not all transition metals may form stable [Np(P,C)M] complexes, there is certainly room to expand the actual diversity. First-raw metals are certainly worth to consider and explore thoroughly. There is no manganese complex known to date, only one tetranuclear copper(I) cluster and very few complexes with iron, cobalt and nickel. So far, only alkyl and aryl groups have been introduced at phosphorus. The substitution pattern may be varied further using heteroaryl, alkoxy, and amino groups to significantly decrease/increase the electron-density at phosphorus. Other P-containing groups than phosphines may also be incorporated. The rich chemistry displayed by [Np(P,C)Au(III)] complexes will certainly stimulate research towards highly reactive complexes, basic transforma-tions and catalytic applications with other metals. Being readily accessible, broadly modulable and very robust, the [Np(P,C)M] platform is very attractive and holds much potential. To date, applications have focused essentially on catalysis, but materials science and medicinal chemistry are certainly worth to be considered too. Indeed, [Np(P,C)M] complexes may well com-plement and eventually outperform the commonly used rigid (N,C)-cyclometalated complexes.",
