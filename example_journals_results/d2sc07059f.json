Published b yntheses of 2-methyl-1,3-diol acetals via Re-catalyzed [1,3]-allylic alcohol transposition† Jiaming Liu and Ming Chen * Rhenium-catalyzed stereoselective transposition of allylic alcohols is reported. In the presence of 1 mol% of Re2O7, (E)-or (Z)-d-hydroxymethyl-anti-homoallylic alcohols were converted into the acetals of 2-methyl-1,3-syn-diols with excellent diastereoselectivities. 1,3-syn-Diol acetals can also be synthesized from (E)-d-hydroxymethyl-syn-homoallylic alcohols. Introduction Polyhydroxylated natural products, oxo polyene macrolide anti-biotics for instance, have played an important role in modern drug discovery.1,2 Driven by a myriad of the biological activities, these natural products have garnered signicant attention from the organic synthesis and chemical biology communities. One indispensible structural motif of these polyhydroxylated natural products is the stereodened 2-methyl-1,3-diol (Fig. 1).3 Tradi-tionally, these 2-methyl-1,3-diols are oen assembled via a reiter-ative carbonyl crotylation approach4 or an aldol–reduction reaction sequence.5 These methods have been widely adopted in the total syntheses of polyhydroxylated natural products. Despite these advances, the development of catalytic methods that permit stereoselective syntheses of these 2-methyl-1,3-diol entities still remains an important objective in organic chemistry. Pioneered by the Osborn group, rhenium catalysts, such as O3ReOSiPh3, Re2O7, have been shown to promote [1,3]-allylic alcohol transposition.6,7 However, the regiochemical control of these reactions is generally poor, resulting in a thermodynamic mixture of allylic alcohols (e.g., A and B, Scheme 1). More recently, several strategies have been developed to address this limitation. For instance, the reaction can be rendered regioselective through capitalizing on alkene conjugation or steric effect.8 High regio-control can also be accomplished through capturing the alcohol group with a trapping agent, thereby shiing the equilibrium toward the desired direction.9 In the context of our program on asymmetric synthesis,10,11 we recently reported enantio-and stereoselective syntheses of d-hydroxymethyl homoallylic alcohols 1, 2 and 3.12 As one venue to explore the synthetic utilities of these molecules, we were intrigued whether the allylic alcohol moiety in 1–3 can undergo , Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, tion (ESI) available.
