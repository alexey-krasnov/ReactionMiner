Mercadoa The insertion of CO2 into metal alkyl bonds is a crucial elementary step in transition metal-catalyzed processes for CO2 utilization. Here, we synthesize pincer-supported palladium complexes of the type (tBuPBP)Pd(alkyl) (tBuPBP = B(NCH2P tBu2)2C6H4 -; alkyl = CH2CH3, CH2CH2CH3, CH2C6H5, and CH2-4-OMe-C6H4) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5) and compare the rates of CO2 insertion into the palladium alkyl bonds to form metal carboxylate complexes. Although, the rate constant for CO2 insertion into ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2CH3) is more than double the rate constant we previously measured for insertion into the palladium methyl complex (tBuPBP)Pd(CH3), insertion into ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) occurs approximately one order of magnitude slower than (tBuPBP)Pd(CH3). CO2 insertion into the benzyl complexes ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2C6H5) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2-4-OMe-C6H4) is significantly slower than any of the n-alkyl complexes, and CO2 does not insert into the palladium phenyl bond of ( tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5). While ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2CH3) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) are resistant to b-hydride elimination, we were unable to synthesize complexes with n-butyl, iso-propyl, and tert-butyl ligands due to b-hydride elimination and an unusual reductive coupling, which involves the formation of new C–B bonds. This reductive process also occurred for (tBuPBP)Pd(CH2C6H5) at elevated temperature and a related process involving the formation of a new H–B bond prevented the isolation of (tBuPBP)PdH. DFT calculations provide insight into the relative rates of CO2 insertion and indicate that steric factors are critical. Overall, this work is one of the first comparative studies of the rates of CO2 insertion into different metal alkyl bonds and provides fundamental information that may be important for the development of new catalysts for CO2 utilization. Introduction There is considerable interest in the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbon containing chemical feedstock due to its low cost, non-toxic nature, and abundance.1 However, only a small number of chemicals are currently industrially produced from CO2.1g This is in part because the kinetic barriers associated with bond forming processes involving CO2 are oen prohibi-tively high. Transition metal catalysts represent a promising method to increase the range of products generated from CO2 because they can create lower energy pathways for activating and functionalizing CO2.1 To date, most transition metal ity, P.

For example, Group 10 catalysts have been used for the formation of carboxylic acids through the carboxylation of Chem. Sci. Chemical Science Edge Article O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

However, at this stage there is limited experimental information on the pathways for CO2 insertion into metal alkyl bonds, as most studies have primarily involved isolated examples with a single metal complex,5–14 and thus, it is unclear how changing the nature of the alkyl group or ancillary ligand impacts the reaction. Further, kinetic studies are relatively rar-e,6,8a,b,9d,11c,13g,14b which means that computational results cannot be benchmarked against experimental data. Previous kinetic studies exploring CO2 insertion into well-dened metal alkyl complexes have almost exclusively focused on metal methyl species.6,8a,b,9d,11c,13g,14b This is because of the stability of metal methyl complexes, which in contrast to longer chain alkyl containing complexes, such as metal ethyl complexes, do not undergo b-hydride elimination. A major limitation in studying CO2 insertion into metal methyl bonds, and in particular the types of Group 10 metal alkyl complexes that are relevant to catalysis, is the paucity of systems that are stable and react under mild reaction conditions. Most systems require high temperatures and do not give quantitative yields of products, which prevents kinetic studies. We recently described the insertion of CO2 into palladium and nickel methyl complexes supported by RPBP (RPBP = B(NCH2PR2)2C6H4 -; R = Cy or tBu) pincer ligands (Fig. 1a).13g The strong trans-inuence of the boryl donor in the pincer ligand destabilizes the methyl group and as a consequence these complexes insert CO2 at room temperature, which enabled us to perform detailed kinetic studies on CO2 insertion into a metal methyl bond. We hypothesized that the RPBP framework may stabilize palladium complexes with other alkyl ligands, as pincer ligands are known to inhibit b-hydride elimination from square planar palladium(II) complexes.15 Further, given that the RPBP ligand can facilitate CO2 insertion reactions under mild conditions,13g we postulated that the synthesis of a family of RPBP supported palladium alkyl complexes would enable us to perform a rare experimental comparison of the rates of CO2 insertion as the alkyl ligand is varied. In this work, we describe the synthesis of a series of tBuPBP supported palladium complexes with ethyl, n-propyl, benzyl, and phenyl ligands.

View Article OnlineBoth 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn were characterized by X-ray crystallog-raphy (Fig. 3a and b). The solid-state structures indicate that the geometry around palladium is distorted square planar and the geometrical parameters associated with the binding of the tBuPBP ligand in 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn are analogous to those in 1-Et and 1-nPr. The long Pd–B bond distances (2.032(4) Å in 1-Bn and 2.025(3) Å in 1-OMeBn) are consistent with the high trans-inuence of the benzyl ligand. The benzyl ligand binds in an h1-fashion with Pd–C bond distances of 2.260(3) Å in 1-Bn and 2.249(3) Å in 1-OMeBn, which are longer than almost all other palladium complexes that feature an h1-benzyl ligand.22 Further, the carbon atom bound to palladium (C(1)) is signi-cantly distorted from tetrahedral, with Pd(1)–C(1)–C(2) angles of 127.7(2)° and 123.44(18)° observed for 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn, respectively. Although this deviation from tetrahedral is typical for Group 10 benzyl complexes,21a,c,23 these are some of the largest angles reported perhaps due to the steric congestion around the palladium. 1-Bn is stable when le in C6D6 at room temperature, but complete decomposition is observed when it is heated for 3 days at 65 °C, with the major product being a new dimeric complex, (tBuPBBnP)2Pd2 (2-Bn, Bn = benzyl) (Fig. 4a). Based on NMR spectroscopy we propose that 1-OMeBn decomposes via a similar pathway (see ESI†). 2-Bn was characterized by X-ray crystallog-raphy (Fig. 4b). In 2-Bn, two new C–B bonds have formed presumably due to a reductive coupling reaction between the benzyl ligands and the boron atom of the tBuPBP ligands. This causes a reduction in the palladium center from palladium(II) in 1-Bn to palladium(0) in 2-Bn. The boron atom of the pincer ligand no longer coordinates to the palladium center and the two phosphorus donors of the new bidentate tBuPBBnP ligands do not coordinate to the same palladium center but instead coordinate to two different palladium atoms.

View Article Onlinesignicant and non-intuitive changes in the rates of CO2 insertion. This is potentially important in catalysis as it implies the rate of CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl complexes (and potentially other metal alkyl complexes) will be heavily substrate dependent. The reactions of the benzyl complexes 1-Bn and 1-OMeBnwith 1 atm of CO2 at room temperature formed the carboxylate complexes (tBuPBP)Pd{OC(O)CH2C6H5} (3-Bn) and ( tBuPBP)Pd {OC(O)CH2-4-OMe-C6H4} (3-OMeBn), respectively (Fig. 6). These reactions were signicantly slower than the corresponding insertion reactions with 1-Me, 1-Et, or even 1-nPr. For example, in C6D6 at room temperature the reactions took approximately 5 days to reach completion. The slower rate of insertion into palladium benzyl complexes compared with palladium n-alkyl complexes is unsurprising as the benzylic carbon bound to palladium is expected to be a worse nucleophile due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the aromatic group, which makes it less energetically favorable to attack electrophilic CO2. In order to measure the kinetics of insertion into 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn we needed to increase the rate of the reaction. Unfor-tunately, it is not possible to raise the temperature to promote CO2 insertion into 1-Bn in C6D6 as this leads to decomposition to form the palladium(0) complex, 2-Bn, as well as the CO2 inserted product. However, we have previously demonstrated that the rates of CO2 insertion reactions can be increased by performing the reaction in solvents with a higher Dimroth– Reichardt ET(30) parameter,13g,32 which is an empirical measure of the polarity of a solvent.33,34 When CO2 insertion reactions were performed in pyridine-d5, the reactions with 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn were complete in approximately 5 hours at room temperature, with no evidence for the formation of palla-dium(0) complexes. This again highlights the dramatic effect of solvent on CO2 insertion reactions.13g,32,35 At 30 °C, the rate constants for CO2 insertion into 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn in pyridine-d5 were 0.0048 ± 0.0005 and 0.0043 ± 0.0004 M -1 s-1, respec-tively. The fact that these values are the same within error indicates that the substitution on the phenyl ring surprisingly does not signicantly affect the nucleophilicity of the carbon bound to palladium and means that in the catalytic carboxyla-tion of benzylic substrates36 the electronic effect of the substit-uents on the rate of CO2 insertion is likely minimal. Unfortunately, we are unable to measure the rate constants for CO2 insertion into 1-Me or 1-Et in pyridine-d5 because the reaction occurs too fast to obtain an accurate rate constant using NMR spectroscopy. However, we estimate a minimum rate constant of 0.2 M-1 s-1, which is signicantly faster than for the benzyl compounds. In contrast to our results with palladium alkyl complexes, no reaction was observed when 1-Ph was treated with 1 atm of CO2, even aer prolonged heating at elevated temperature. Although at this stage it is unclear whether kinetic or thermodynamic factors are responsible for the lack of reactivity, our result is consistent with observations for other pincer supported Group 10 phenyl complexes, which also do not react with CO2.13b,e Hence, although the PBP ligand promotes CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl complexes, it does not facilitate insertion reactions into palladium aryl complexes. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Computational studies of CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl and aryl complexes We performed DFT calculations (PBE0-D3BJ, IEFPCM) to further understand the mechanism of CO2 insertion into 1-Me, 1-Et, 1-nPr, 1-Bn, and 1-OMeBn. Previously, we have demon-strated that CO2 insertion into 1-Me follows an SE2 (or outer-sphere) pathway (Fig. 9a),13g in which the rst and rate-limiting step is nucleophilic attack of the carbon atom of the palladium methyl on the electrophilic carbon atom of CO2 to form the C–C bond. Notably, there is no interaction between CO2 and the palladium center at the transition state. The second step in CO2 insertion into 1-Me via an SE2 pathway has a signicantly lower barrier and involves the rearrangement of an carboxylate-palladium ion pair, bound through a C–H s-bond, to the neutral Pd–O containing product.13g An alternative pathway involving 1,2-insertion (innersphere, Fig. 9b) in which both the Pd–O and C–C bonds are formed at the same transition state was calculated to be energetically unfavorable for 1-Me. Here, we calculated that for CO2 insertion into 1-Et, the barrier for the rst step in the SE2 pathway is 17.7 kcal mol -1 at 298 K (Fig. 10, Table 3).37 This is in good agreement with the experimentally determined barrier of 20.0± 2.0 kcal mol-1 (vide supra). The barrier for the innersphere 1,2-insertion pathway is calculated to be 26.0 kcal mol-1, unambiguously indicating that the SE2 pathway is preferred. A surprising feature of 1-Et is that it does not undergo facile b-hydride elimination. We calculated that the barrier for b-hydride elimination is relatively high (32.3 kcal mol-1), consistent with the stability of the complex towards b-hydride elimination. b-Hydride elimination is presumably disfavored because of the rigidity of the pincer ligand, which makes it energetically difficult for the complex to distort to form the syn co-planar arrangement of the palladium, Ca, Cb, and H required for b-hydride elimination. DFT calculations predict that the barriers for CO2 insertion into 1-Me and 1-nPr are 19.4 kcal mol-1 and 21.8 kcal mol-1(Table 3), respectively, which means that the calculations are in line with the experimental trends in rate (1-Et > 1-Me > 1-nPr).38 The rate-determining transition states for CO2 insertion into 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-nPr are analogous (the rst step in the SE2 mechanism), so the differences in rate are not related to a change in mechanism. Instead, we propose that the difference in rates is due primarily to steric factors, which affect the relative stability of both the reactant complexes and the transition states. 1-Et and 1-nPr are likely slightly destabilized relative to 1-Me because of steric interactions between the ethyl or propyl ligand and the tert-butyl substituents of the tBuPBP ligand. This is reected by the increased thermodynamic favorability of CO2 insertion into 1-Et and 1-nPr compared to 1-Me (DG° = -27.5 and -26.2 kcal mol-1, respectively, versus -22.9 kcal mol-1). Presumably, in the carboxylate complexes, the steric pressure is relieved because of the absence of hydro-gens on the oxygen bound to palladium. The steric properties of 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-nPr were quanti-tatively evaluated by calculating the percent buried volume (% VBur) of these complexes based on their crystal structures using the Salerno molecular buried volume program (SambVca 2.1) Chem.

Here, we synthesize pincer-supported palladium complexes of the type (tBuPBP)Pd(alkyl) (tBuPBP = B(NCH2P tBu2)2C6H4 -; alkyl = CH2CH3, CH2CH2CH3, CH2C6H5, and CH2-4-OMe-C6H4) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5) and compare the rates of CO2 insertion into the palladium alkyl bonds to form metal carboxylate complexes. Although, the rate constant for CO2 insertion into ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2CH3) is more than double the rate constant we previously measured for insertion into the palladium methyl complex (tBuPBP)Pd(CH3), insertion into ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) occurs approximately one order of magnitude slower than (tBuPBP)Pd(CH3). CO2 insertion into the benzyl complexes ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2C6H5) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2-4-OMe-C6H4) is significantly slower than any of the n-alkyl complexes, and CO2 does not insert into the palladium phenyl bond of ( tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5). While ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2CH3) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) are resistant to b-hydride elimination, we were unable to synthesize complexes with n-butyl, iso-propyl, and tert-butyl ligands due to b-hydride elimination and an unusual reductive coupling, which involves the formation of new C–B bonds. This reductive process also occurred for (tBuPBP)Pd(CH2C6H5) at elevated temperature and a related process involving the formation of a new H–B bond prevented the isolation of (tBuPBP)PdH. DFT calculations provide insight into the relative rates of CO2 insertion and indicate that steric factors are critical. Overall, this work is one of the first comparative studies of the rates of CO2 insertion into different metal alkyl bonds and provides fundamental information that may be important for the development of new catalysts for CO2 utilization.",
        "Introduction There is considerable interest in the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbon containing chemical feedstock due to its low cost, non-toxic nature, and abundance.1 However, only a small number of chemicals are currently industrially produced from CO2.1g This is in part because the kinetic barriers associated with bond forming processes involving CO2 are oen prohibi-tively high. Transition metal catalysts represent a promising method to increase the range of products generated from CO2 because they can create lower energy pathways for activating and functionalizing CO2.1 To date, most transition metalESI) available.

For or other electronic format see DOI:y the Royal Society of Chemistrycatalysts for CO2 utilization have converted CO2 into other C1 products such as methane, CO, formic acid, and methanol and there are limited examples of catalysts that can form products containing C–C bonds, such as fuels, from CO2.1g As a result, the formation of products containing a C–C bond from CO2 has been identied as a high priority research area by the United States National Academies of Science.2In many transition metal catalyzed processes for CO2 utili-zation, the insertion of CO2 into a metal–E s-bond (for example E = H, OR, NR2, or CR3) is a crucial elementary step (eqn (1)).3 This is especially the case for late transition metals, where the relative weakness of the M–O bonds makes subsequent cleavage of the M–O bond more facile.3 The insertion of CO2 into a metal alkyl bond is a particularly important reaction because it can ultimately result in the generation of products containing a C–C bond. For example, Group 10 catalysts have been used for the formation of carboxylic acids through the carboxylation ofChem. Sci.",
        "Onlinea variety of alkyl halides and pseudo halides.4 In these reactions, C–C bonds are proposed to form between CO2 and the alkyl electrophile via the insertion of CO2 into a metal alkyl bond. However, at this stage there is limited experimental information on the pathways for CO2 insertion into metal alkyl bonds, as most studies have primarily involved isolated examples with a single metal complex,5–14 and thus, it is unclear how changing the nature of the alkyl group or ancillary ligand impacts the reaction. Further, kinetic studies are relatively rar-e,6,8a,b,9d,11c,13g,14b which means that computational results cannot be benchmarked against experimental data. Previous kinetic studies exploring CO2 insertion into well-dened metal alkyl complexes have almost exclusively focused on metal methyl species.6,8a,b,9d,11c,13g,14b This is because of the stability of metal methyl complexes, which in contrast to longer chain alkyl containing complexes, such as metal ethyl complexes, do not undergo b-hydride elimination. A major limitation in studying CO2 insertion into metal methyl bonds, and in particular the types of Group 10 metal alkyl complexes that are relevant to catalysis, is the paucity of systems that are stable and react under mild reaction conditions. Most systems require high temperatures and do not give quantitative yields of products, which prevents kinetic studies. We recently described the insertion of CO2 into palladium and nickel methyl complexes supported by RPBP (RPBP = B(NCH2PR2)2C6H4 -; R = Cy or tBu) pincer ligands (Fig. 1a).13g The strong trans-inuence of the boryl donor in the pincer ligand destabilizes the methyl group and as a consequence these complexes insert CO2 at room temperature, which enabled us to perform detailed kinetic studies on CO2 insertion into a metal methyl bond. We hypothesized that the RPBP framework may stabilize palladium complexes with other alkyl ligands, as pincer ligands are known to inhibit b-hydride elimination from square planar palladium(II) complexes.15 Further, given that the RPBP ligand can facilitate CO2 insertion reactions under mild conditions,13g we postulated that the synthesis of a family of RPBP supported palladium alkyl complexes would enable us to perform a rare experimental comparison of the rates of CO2 insertion as the alkyl ligand is varied. In this work, we describe the synthesis of a series of tBuPBP supported palladium complexes with ethyl, n-propyl, benzyl, and phenyl ligands. Although (tBuPBP)Pd(CH2-CH3) (1-Et), ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) (1-nPr), (tBuPBP)OnlineBoth 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn were characterized by X-ray crystallog-raphy (Fig. 3a and b). The solid-state structures indicate that the geometry around palladium is distorted square planar and the geometrical parameters associated with the binding of the tBuPBP ligand in 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn are analogous to those in 1-Et and 1-nPr. The long Pd–B bond distances (2.032(4) Å in 1-Bn and 2.025(3) Å in 1-OMeBn) are consistent with the high trans-inuence of the benzyl ligand. The benzyl ligand binds in an h1-fashion with Pd–C bond distances of 2.260(3) Å in 1-Bn and 2.249(3) Å in 1-OMeBn, which are longer than almost all other palladium complexes that feature an h1-benzyl ligand.22 Further, the carbon atom bound to palladium (C(1)) is signi-cantly distorted from tetrahedral, with Pd(1)–C(1)–C(2) angles of 127.7(2)° and 123.44(18)° observed for 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn, respectively. Although this deviation from tetrahedral is typical for Group 10 benzyl complexes,21a,c,23 these are some of the largest angles reported perhaps due to the steric congestion around the palladium. 1-Bn is stable when le in C6D6 at room temperature, but complete decomposition is observed when it is heated for 3 days at 65 °C, with the major product being a new dimeric complex, (tBuPBBnP)2Pd2 (2-Bn, Bn = benzyl) (Fig. 4a). Based on NMR spectroscopy we propose that 1-OMeBn decomposes via a similar pathway (see ESI†). 2-Bn was characterized by X-ray crystallog-raphy (Fig. 4b). In 2-Bn, two new C–B bonds have formed presumably due to a reductive coupling reaction between the benzyl ligands and the boron atom of the tBuPBP ligands. This causes a reduction in the palladium center from palladium(II) in 1-Bn to palladium(0) in 2-Bn. The boron atom of the pincer ligand no longer coordinates to the palladium center and the two phosphorus donors of the new bidentate tBuPBBnP ligands do not coordinate to the same palladium center but instead coordinate to two different palladium atoms. The pathway forOnlinesignicant and non-intuitive changes in the rates of CO2 insertion. This is potentially important in catalysis as it implies the rate of CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl complexes (and potentially other metal alkyl complexes) will be heavily substrate dependent. The reactions of the benzyl complexes 1-Bn and 1-OMeBnwith 1 atm of CO2 at room temperature formed the carboxylate complexes (tBuPBP)Pd{OC(O)CH2C6H5} (3-Bn) and ( tBuPBP)Pd {OC(O)CH2-4-OMe-C6H4} (3-OMeBn), respectively (Fig. 6). These reactions were signicantly slower than the corresponding insertion reactions with 1-Me, 1-Et, or even 1-nPr. For example, in C6D6 at room temperature the reactions took approximately 5 days to reach completion. The slower rate of insertion into palladium benzyl complexes compared with palladium n-alkyl complexes is unsurprising as the benzylic carbon bound to palladium is expected to be a worse nucleophile due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the aromatic group, which makes it less energetically favorable to attack electrophilic CO2. In order to measure the kinetics of insertion into 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn we needed to increase the rate of the reaction. Unfor-tunately, it is not possible to raise the temperature to promote CO2 insertion into 1-Bn in C6D6 as this leads to decomposition to form the palladium(0) complex, 2-Bn, as well as the CO2 inserted product. However, we have previously demonstrated that the rates of CO2 insertion reactions can be increased by performing the reaction in solvents with a higher Dimroth– Reichardt ET(30) parameter,13g,32 which is an empirical measure of the polarity of a solvent.33,34 When CO2 insertion reactions were performed in pyridine-d5, the reactions with 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn were complete in approximately 5 hours at room temperature, with no evidence for the formation of palla-dium(0) complexes. This again highlights the dramatic effect of solvent on CO2 insertion reactions.13g,32,35 At 30 °C, the rate constants for CO2 insertion into 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn in pyridine-d5 were 0.0048 ± 0.0005 and 0.0043 ± 0.0004 M -1 s-1, respec-tively. The fact that these values are the same within error indicates that the substitution on the phenyl ring surprisingly does not signicantly affect the nucleophilicity of the carbon bound to palladium and means that in the catalytic carboxyla-tion of benzylic substrates36 the electronic effect of the substit-uents on the rate of CO2 insertion is likely minimal. Unfortunately, we are unable to measure the rate constants for CO2 insertion into 1-Me or 1-Et in pyridine-d5 because the reaction occurs too fast to obtain an accurate rate constant using NMR spectroscopy. However, we estimate a minimum rate constant of 0.2 M-1 s-1, which is signicantly faster than for the benzyl compounds. In contrast to our results with palladium alkyl complexes, no reaction was observed when 1-Ph was treated with 1 atm of CO2, even aer prolonged heating at elevated temperature. Although at this stage it is unclear whether kinetic or thermodynamic factors are responsible for the lack of reactivity, our result is consistent with observations for other pincer supported Group 10 phenyl complexes, which also do not react with CO2.13b,e Hence, although the PBP ligand promotes CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl complexes, it does not facilitate insertion reactions into palladium aryl complexes.",
        "© 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryComputational studies of CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl and aryl complexes We performed DFT calculations (PBE0-D3BJ, IEFPCM) to further understand the mechanism of CO2 insertion into 1-Me, 1-Et, 1-nPr, 1-Bn, and 1-OMeBn. Previously, we have demon-strated that CO2 insertion into 1-Me follows an SE2 (or outer-sphere) pathway (Fig. 9a),13g in which the rst and rate-limiting step is nucleophilic attack of the carbon atom of the palladium methyl on the electrophilic carbon atom of CO2 to form the C–C bond. Notably, there is no interaction between CO2 and the palladium center at the transition state. The second step in CO2 insertion into 1-Me via an SE2 pathway has a signicantly lower barrier and involves the rearrangement of an carboxylate-palladium ion pair, bound through a C–H s-bond, to the neutral Pd–O containing product.13g An alternative pathway involving 1,2-insertion (innersphere, Fig. 9b) in which both the Pd–O and C–C bonds are formed at the same transition state was calculated to be energetically unfavorable for 1-Me. Here, we calculated that for CO2 insertion into 1-Et, the barrier for the rst step in the SE2 pathway is 17.7 kcal mol -1 at 298 K (Fig. 10, Table 3).37 This is in good agreement with the experimentally determined barrier of 20.0± 2.0 kcal mol-1 (vide supra). The barrier for the innersphere 1,2-insertion pathway is calculated to be 26.0 kcal mol-1, unambiguously indicating that the SE2 pathway is preferred. A surprising feature of 1-Et is that it does not undergo facile b-hydride elimination. We calculated that the barrier for b-hydride elimination is relatively high (32.3 kcal mol-1), consistent with the stability of the complex towards b-hydride elimination. b-Hydride elimination is presumably disfavored because of the rigidity of the pincer ligand, which makes it energetically difficult for the complex to distort to form the syn co-planar arrangement of the palladium, Ca, Cb, and H required for b-hydride elimination. DFT calculations predict that the barriers for CO2 insertion into 1-Me and 1-nPr are 19.4 kcal mol-1 and 21.8 kcal mol-1(Table 3), respectively, which means that the calculations are in line with the experimental trends in rate (1-Et > 1-Me > 1-nPr).38 The rate-determining transition states for CO2 insertion into 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-nPr are analogous (the rst step in the SE2 mechanism), so the differences in rate are not related to a change in mechanism. Instead, we propose that the difference in rates is due primarily to steric factors, which affect the relative stability of both the reactant complexes and the transition states. 1-Et and 1-nPr are likely slightly destabilized relative to 1-Me because of steric interactions between the ethyl or propyl ligand and the tert-butyl substituents of the tBuPBP ligand. This is reected by the increased thermodynamic favorability of CO2 insertion into 1-Et and 1-nPr compared to 1-Me (DG° = -27.5 and -26.2 kcal mol-1, respectively, versus -22.9 kcal mol-1). Presumably, in the carboxylate complexes, the steric pressure is relieved because of the absence of hydro-gens on the oxygen bound to palladium. The steric properties of 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-nPr were quanti-tatively evaluated by calculating the percent buried volume (% VBur) of these complexes based on their crystal structures using the Salerno molecular buried volume program (SambVca 2.1)Chem. Sci.",
        "Onlinepromotes CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl complexes, no reaction is observed between 1-Ph and CO2. Overall, our results highlight how the rates of CO2 vary across an analogous series of palladium alkyl and aryl complexes and DFT calculations provide explanations for the observed trends. This information will be valuable for the development of catalytic reactions that involve CO2 insertion into metal alkyl bonds as an elementary step.",

In the ESI,† we have described experiments that were performed to discount this possibility. 32 J. E. Heimann, W. H. Bernskoetter and N.

It is found by measuring the lmax of Betaine 30 in a particular solventChem. Sci.",
        "and a smaller lmax corresponds to a larger wavenumber and therefore a more polar solvent. 35 (a) J. E. Heimann, W. H. Bernskoetter, N. Hazari and J. M.

However, this process has previously been demonstrated to be low energy in related systems. 38 The calculated increase in barrier from 1-Et (17.7 kcal mol-1) to 1-Me (19.4 kcal mol-1) is around 1 kcal mol-1 larger than would be expected for a two-fold difference in rate. Nevertheless, this is good agreement when computational error is considered. 39 L. Falivene, R. Credendino, A. Poater, A. Petta, L. Serra, R. Oliva, V. Scarano and L. Cavallo, SambVca 2.
