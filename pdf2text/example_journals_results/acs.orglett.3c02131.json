Among them, compounds 4-10 showed good detonation properties and excellent thermostability. By treating nitrogen-rich fused ring 3 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, a new type of Dimroth rearrangement was observed that afforded compound 12 efficiently. This new transformation herein constitutes a valuable addition to the Dimroth rearrangement. The tetrazole scaffolds have been of great interest and arewidely used in the fields of pharmaceutical science,1 organic chemistry,2 and material science.3 On the other hand, tetrazole moieties as energetic backbones have drawn much attention in recent decades because of their distinguished characteristics, including easy synthetic feasibility, high nitro-gen content, relatively low sensitivity, and good stability. Therefore, much efforts have been paid on the development of high-energy-density materials (HEDMs) bearing tetrazole derivatives.4 In this context, many linked or bridged tetrazoles have been synthesized via the combination of tetrazoles and linkers, thus affording different kinds of bis-, tris-, and tetra-tetrazole energetic materials.5 Although most of the linkers are energetic moieties, a variety of them are limited to the chain linkers (e.g., -N�N-, -N-N-, and -N-) and monocyclic ring linkers (e.g., furazan, triazole, and pyrazole) (panels a and b of Figure 1). The diversity of bistetrazole-based energetic materials still needs to be expanded to meet the requirement of HEDMs. Introducing the fused ring into energetic compounds, which are named after fused cyclic energetic materials, has been identified as competitive candidates for HEDMs. Fused heterocyclic-ring-based energetic materials bearing a coplanar polycyclic structure possess considerably higher heats of formation and ring strain energy stored in the molecules, thus exhibiting excellent characteristics of good energetic performance, enhanced thermal stability, and low sensitivities.6 Inspired by this fact, we envisioned that incorporating tetrazoles and an energetic fused ring may generate novel nitrogen-rich energetic materials (Figure 1c). Moreover, considering that the acidic proton exited in the tetrazole ring, further transformation to ionic compounds would be possible to further increase the nitrogen content and decrease the sensitivity. We anticipate that a series of new fused ring energetic ionic materials bearing bistetrazoles would be synthesized efficiently. Received: June 30, 2023 Herein, we report a practical synthesis of a new nitrogen-rich fused ring linker that could be used for the construction of tetrazole-based energetic materials. In this regard, a series of new family bistetrzole-based energetic ionic compounds were synthesized, and their energetic properties, including thermal stabilities, sensitivities, and calculated detonation performances were performed. We initially carried out the diazotization of 5-amino-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carbonitrile (1),7 which produced the diazo-nium intermediate 2 (Scheme 1a). Without the isolation of compound 2, subsequent addition of sodium malononitrile led to the fused ring compound 3 in 84% yield. With the double -CN groups in compound 3, the zinc-chloride-promoted reaction of compound 3 with sodium azide proceeded smoothly to afford bistetrazole 4 in 85% yield. As a result of the acidic proton existing in compound 4, the incorporation of nitrogen-rich energetic bases to compound 4 generated a series of bistetrazole-based energetic salts 5-10 in 73-88% yields (Scheme 1a). Interestingly, when we subjected energetic salt 9 to the mixed solvent of acetone and water, the condensation reaction between the cation of compound 9 and acetone would occur, affording a new energetic salt 11. The structure of compound 11 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Scheme 1b). The single crystal of compound 4 was obtained by slow evaporation from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). As shown in Figure 2a, the crystallization of compound 4 contains one molecular DMSO and H2O, which is in the triclinic space group P1̅, with two molecules in the unit cell (Z = 2). The short bond length of 2.090 Å between N4 and the proton on N5 indicated a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond effect. In addition, all atoms of compound 4 are in the same plane (Figure 2b), which is confirmed by the torsion angles of N1-C1-C2-N6 [2.7(2)°], N5-C1-C2-C3 [-1.4(2)°], C4-C5-C6-N14 [-1.2(3)°] , and N6-N7-N9-N10 [-179.15(14)°]. Moreover, the crystal packing of compound 4 exhibits an intense face-to-face stacking with an interlayer distance of 3.223 Å, which is shorter than the typical geometrical parameters of aromatic π-π interactions (3.65-4.00 Å).8 All of these results suggest that this bistetrazole-based fused energetic compound 4 may have relatively low sensitivity. On the other hand, compound 11 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1̅, possessing two molecules in the unit cell (Z = 2) with 0.25 molecular H2O of crystallization. As for the anion moiety, the intramolecular hydrogen bond could also be seen from the short bond length (2.066 Å) between N4 and the proton on N10 (Figure 2d). However, different from the molecule of compound 4, in this regard, the atoms in the anion are in an arc-like plane (Figure 2e). In addition, the crystal packing of compound 11 exhibits a cage-like structure (Figure 2f). To further verify their planar properties, the analysis of molecular planarity parameters (MPPs) and span of deviation from the plane (SDP) was carried out.9 As shown in Figure 3a, all atoms in compound 4 are almost white, which proves that the planarity of compound 4 is excellent. In contrast, the big deviation to the fitting plane of the anion of compound 11 is observed, with the red and blue color atoms shown in Figure 3b. Nevertheless, in both cases, the maximum span perpendicular to the fitting plane is less than 0.3 Å, which is beneficial for the conjugation of π electrons. The physicochemical and detonation properties of these energetic compounds were then investigated (Table 1). The thermal stabilities were carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a scan rate of 5 °C min-1. As a result, all compounds 4-11 possess excellent thermal stabilities. The decompose temperatures ranged from 207 to 266 °C, which are higher than that of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). A gas pycnometer was then used to measure the true densities of these compounds. The densities of compounds 4-11 are in the range of 1.462-1.856 g cm-3. It should be noted that compound 4, which possesses the highest density of 1.856 g cm-3, is even higher than that of RDX (1.80 g cm-3). The heat of formation was calculated by the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.10 All compounds have a relatively high heat of formation (764.5-1547.6 kJ mol-1). Detonation velocities (Dv) and pressures (P) were calculated by EXPLO5 software. 11 The detonation velocities of compounds 4-10 lie in the range of 8024-8679 m s-1 and are much higher than that of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and close to that of RDX (8795 m s-1). The detonation pressures of compounds 4-10 lie in the range of 21.8-26.4 GPa, which are close to that of TNT (21.3 GPa). The impact sensitivities (IS) and friction sensitivities (FS) were measured by BAM sensitivity testers. As a result, compounds 4, 9, and 11 have relatively lower sensitivities (IS = 13 J and FS = 240 N, IS = 40 J and FS = 252 N, and IS = 40 J and FS = 252 N, respectively) than that of RDX (IS = 7.5 J and FS = 120 N). An independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH)14 was then employed to investigate the sensitivity and weak interaction. The π-π interaction (green) and hydrogen bond (HB, blue) of compounds 4 (Figure 4a) and 11 (Figure 4d) are beneficial to their sensitivities. Hirshfeld surface analysis and a two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint plot were employed to gain insight into the weak interaction in depth.15 As shown in panels b and e of Figure 4, the red dots that appear on the edge of the surfaces indicate the high intimate contact, such as O···H and N···H interactions, whereas the blue regions indicate the low intimate contact, such as the interactions of the two groups, C···N and N···O interactions. The predominant interactions are exhibited in panels c and f of Figure 4. The percentages of N···H interactions in compounds 4 and 11 are 49.9 and 53.9%, respectively. The hydrogen-bond interaction N···H herein is supposed to be the main reason for their relatively lower mechanical sensitivities. At last, we were pleased to find that the fused linker 3 could be easily transformed to compound 12 via a new type of Dimroth rearrangement16 (Figure 5a). The structure of compound 12 was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The mechanism of the transformation is proposed, which is shown in Figure 5b. Hydrochloric acid first activates the N site of the fused ring, which promotes the ring-opening reaction via intermediate I to afford the intermediate II. Then, Cl-serves as the nucleophile to attack the -CN group, inducing the ring-closure reaction to give intermediate III. The aromatization then occurs via intra-molecular isomerization to generate intermediate IV. Com-pound 12 would be obtained after the hydrolysis of -CN to the amide group.17 In conclusion, a new family of bistetrazole energetic compounds bearing a nitrogen-rich fused ring were designed and synthesized. The compounds 4-10 showed good detonation properties and excellent thermostability. The treatment of compound 3 with concentrated HCl induced a new type of Dimroth rearrangement, which provides a new strategy for molecular diversity. We expect that this method-ology as well as the new energetic compounds have potential applications in both organic chemistry and energetic materials.

        "tetrazole scaffolds have been of great interest and arewidely used in the fields of pharmaceutical science,1organic chemistry,2 and material science.3 On the other hand, tetrazole moieties as energetic backbones have drawn much attention in recent decades because of their distinguished characteristics, including easy synthetic feasibility, high nitro-gen content, relatively low sensitivity, and good stability. Therefore, much efforts have been paid on the development of high-energy-density materials (HEDMs) bearing tetrazole derivatives.4 In this context, many linked or bridged tetrazoles have been synthesized via the combination of tetrazoles and linkers, thus affording different kinds of bis-, tris-, and tetra-tetrazole energetic materials.5 Although most of the linkers are energetic moieties, a variety of them are limited to the chain linkers (e.g., -N�N-, -N-N-, and -N-) and monocyclic ring linkers (e.g., furazan, triazole, and pyrazole) (panels a and b of Figure 1). The diversity of bistetrazole-based energetic materials still needs to be expanded to meet the requirement of HEDMs.",
        "Introducing the fused ring into energetic compounds, which are named after fused cyclic energetic materials, has been identified as competitive candidates for HEDMs. Fused heterocyclic-ring-based energetic materials bearing a coplanar polycyclic structure possess considerably higher heats of formation and ring strain energy stored in the molecules, thus exhibiting excellent characteristics of good energetic performance, enhanced thermal stability, and low sensitivities.6 Inspired by this fact, we envisioned that incorporating tetrazoles and an energetic fused ring may generate novel nitrogen-rich energetic materials (Figure 1c). Moreover, considering that the acidic proton exited in the tetrazole ring, further transformation to ionic compounds would be possible to further increase the nitrogen content and decrease the sensitivity. We anticipate that a series of new fused ring energetic ionic materials bearing bistetrazoles would be synthesized efficiently.",
        "Herein, we report a practical synthesis of a new nitrogen-rich fused ring linker that could be used for the construction of tetrazole-based energetic materials. In this regard, a series of new family bistetrzole-based energetic ionic compounds were synthesized, and their energetic properties, including thermal stabilities, sensitivities, and calculated detonation performances were performed.",
        "We initially carried out the diazotization of 5-amino-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carbonitrile (1),7 which produced the diazo-nium intermediate 2 (Scheme 1a). Without the isolation ofcompound 2, subsequent addition of sodium malononitrile led to the fused ring compound 3 in 84% yield. With the double -CN groups in compound 3, the zinc-chloride-promoted reaction of compound 3 with sodium azide proceeded smoothly to afford bistetrazole 4 in 85% yield. As a result of the acidic proton existing in compound 4, the incorporation of nitrogen-rich energetic bases to compound 4 generated a series of bistetrazole-based energetic salts 5-10 in 73-88% yields (Scheme 1a). Interestingly, when we subjected energetic salt 9 to the mixed solvent of acetone and water, the condensation reaction between the cation of compound 9 and acetone would occur, affording a new energetic salt 11. The structure of compound 11 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Scheme 1b).",
        "The single crystal of compound 4 was obtained by slow evaporation from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). As shown in Figure 2a, the crystallization of compound 4 contains one molecular DMSO and H2O, which is in the triclinic space group P1̅, with two molecules in the unit cell (Z = 2). The short bond length of 2.090 Å between N4 and the proton on N5 indicated a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond effect. In addition, all atoms of compound 4 are in the same plane (Figure 2b), which is confirmed by the torsion angles of N1-C1-C2-N6 [2.7(2)°], N5-C1-C2-C3 [-1.4(2)°], C4-C5-C6-N14 [-1.2(3)°] , and N6-N7-N9-N10 [-179.15(14)°]. Moreover, the crystal packing of compound 4 exhibits an intense face-to-face stacking with an interlayer distance of 3.223 Å, which is shorter than the typical geometrical parameters of aromatic π-π interactions (3.65-4.00 Å).8 All of these results suggest that this bistetrazole-based fused energetic compound 4 may have relatively low sensitivity.",
        "On the other hand, compound 11 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1̅, possessing two molecules in the unit cell (Z = 2) with 0.25 molecular H2O of crystallization. As for the anion moiety, the intramolecular hydrogen bond could also be seen from the short bond length (2.066 Å) between N4 and the proton on N10 (Figure 2d). However, different from the molecule of compound 4, in this regard, the atoms in the anion are in an arc-like plane (Figure 2e). In addition, the crystal packing of compound 11 exhibits a cage-like structure (Figure 2f).",
        "To further verify their planar properties, the analysis of molecular planarity parameters (MPPs) and span of deviation from the plane (SDP) was carried out.9 As shown in Figure 3a, all atoms in compound 4 are almost white, which proves that the planarity of compound 4 is excellent. In contrast, the big deviation to the fitting plane of the anion of compound 11 is observed, with the red and blue color atoms shown in Figure 3b. Nevertheless, in both cases, the maximum span perpendicular to the fitting plane is less than 0.3 Å, which is beneficial for the conjugation of π electrons.",
        "The physicochemical and detonation properties of these energetic compounds were then investigated (Table 1). The thermal stabilities were carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a scan rate of 5 °C min-1. As a result, all compounds 4-11 possess excellent thermal stabilities. The decompose temperatures ranged from 207 to 266 °C, whichare higher than that of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). A gas pycnometer was then used to measure the true densities of these compounds. The densities of compounds 4-11 are in the range of 1.462-1.856 g cm-3. It should be noted that compound 4, which possesses the highest density of 1.856 g cm-3, is even higher than that of RDX (1.80 g cm-3).",
        "The heat of formation was calculated by the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.10 All compounds have a relatively high heat of formation (764.5-1547.6 kJ mol-1). Detonation velocities (Dv) and pressures (P) were calculated by EXPLO5 software. 11 The detonation velocities of compounds 4-10 lie in the range of 8024-8679 m s-1 and are much higher than that of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and close to that of RDX (8795 m s-1). The detonation pressures of compounds 4-10 lie in the range of 21.8-26.4 GPa, which are close to that of TNT (21.3 GPa). The impact sensitivities (IS) and friction sensitivities (FS) were measured by BAM sensitivity testers. As a result, compounds 4, 9, and 11 have relatively lower sensitivities (IS = 13 J and FS = 240 N, IS = 40 J and FS = 252 N, and IS = 40 J and FS = 252 N, respectively) than that of RDX (IS = 7.5 J and FS = 120 N).",
        "An independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH)14 was then employed to investigate the sensitivity and weak interaction. The π-π interaction (green) and hydrogen bond (HB, blue) of compounds 4 (Figure 4a) and 11 (Figure 4d) are beneficial to their sensitivities. Hirshfeld surface analysis and a two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint plot were employed to gain insight into the weak interaction in depth.15 As shown in panels b and e of Figure 4, the red dots that appear on the edge of the surfaces indicate the high intimate contact, such as O···H and N···H interactions, whereas the blue regions indicate the low intimate contact, such as the interactions of the two groups, C···N and N···O interactions. The predominant interactions are exhibited in panels c and f of Figure 4. The percentages of N···H interactions in compounds 4 and 11 are 49.9 and 53.9%, respectively. The hydrogen-bond interaction N···H herein is supposed to be the main reason for their relatively lower mechanical sensitivities.",
        "At last, we were pleased to find that the fused linker 3 could be easily transformed to compound 12 via a new type of Dimroth rearrangement16 (Figure 5a). The structure of compound 12 was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The mechanism of the transformation is proposed, which is shown in Figure 5b. Hydrochloric acid first activates the N site of the fused ring, which promotes the ring-opening reaction via intermediate I to afford the intermediate II. Then, Cl-serves as the nucleophile to attack the -CN group, inducing the ring-closure reaction to give intermediate III. The aromatization then occurs via intra-molecular isomerization to generate intermediate IV. Com-pound 12 would be obtained after the hydrolysis of -CN to the amide group.17In conclusion, a new family of bistetrazole energetic compounds bearing a nitrogen-rich fused ring were designed and synthesized. The compounds 4-10 showed good detonation properties and excellent thermostability. The treatment of compound 3 with concentrated HCl induced a new type of Dimroth rearrangement, which provides a newstrategy for molecular diversity. We expect that this method-ology as well as the new energetic compounds have potential applications in both organic chemistry and energetic materials.",
